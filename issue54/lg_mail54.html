Subject: Help wanted - updating a Linux distro's ISO image </p>

<p>While downloading the newly posted kernel updates to RedHat
6.2 the following question arose in my mind the answer to which
might be of use to anyone who has to build numerous Linux boxes.
If one were to replace arbitrary RPM (or DEB, or ...) files on
the distro with updated versions and burn a new CDROM - would it
still install cleanly? If I understand this correctly the answer
to this is &quot;yes&quot; if the installer runs:<br>
<pre>rpm -install kernel-doc</pre>
But will be &quot;no&quot; (unless you can frig the install
script) if it runs:<br>

<pre>rpm -install kernel-doc-2.2.14-12.i386.rpm</pre>
Can anyone give me an answer? An inquiring mind wants to know...<br>
<br>
Andy.</p>

Subject: bread in fat_access not found (error from Redhat 6)<br>
<br>
The following error was scrolled down the screen: </p>

<pre>bread in fat_access not found </pre>

<p>We are running Redhat version 6 on a PC and it has been
running fine for about 6 months. The latest work done has been to
start using CVS which was installed with the initial installation
of Redhat. CVS has been working fine for about a week. Since the
bread error appeared we are unable to login either at the console
or remotely using telnet from windows. Every time we try to login
the &quot;login incorrect&quot; error appears. We have tried all
user names and root. The strange thing is that we can still use
CVS from our Windows machines using WinCVS 1.0.6 to login and
check files in and out. Basically we can't login normally at all.
Has any body seen this before? Or know what 'bread' is? Any help
or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<br>
Hi,<br>
<br>
I've been trying to figure out how to redirect console output
from tty1 to a file when starting kdm. <br>
<br>
I use an alias: 
<pre>startx=&quot;startx &gt;&amp; /root/startx.txt&quot;</pre>
with startx to send output to
/root/startx.txt, but I can't figure out what to do to get the
same thing to happen with kdm.<br>
<br>
I'm suprised this isn't the default anyway. You can't read the
console output when starting kdm, and if you have mc or something
running on tty1, it gets trashed when kdm starts up.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.<br>

Subject: Is There a Version of PC/NFS for Linux? <br>
<br>
<br>
I have the O'Reilly book Managing NFS and NIS and there is a
section in the back of the book called PC/NFS describing a Unix
utility that enables a PC DOS machine to access a Unix machine
using the NFS file system as an extended DOS file system. I am
wondering if there is a Linux version of this available? </p>

<p>J.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>[As far as I was aware, that program is an NFS client
    for the PC - it runs<br>
    on DOS, and lets you use NFS from a remote UNIX box. If I'm
    right, the<br>
    standard version should work with Linux.<br>
    <br>
    You'd be better off setting up Samba though. It does what
    you're looking<br>
    for - makes Linux look like an MS server. This would be
    better for Ghost,<br>
    as Ghost works on MS shares. -Alex.]</em></p>

I have tried doing it using the CDROM of my second PC running
windows 98, with cisco TFTP server and a local LAN between both
PC´s using a coax. 10 base2 cable.<br>
Where can I find a detailed explanation with some suggestions to
my problem? The manuals included with my linux flavours are not

How about an installation from a FTP site?, where can I find some

Howdy I have 2 problems. First and foremost I believe is when I
boot up linux none of my window managers will work. In my old
computer they did but not in my new one. I think it is because my
graphics card is not compatible but not sure about that I know
that it is not listed in setup but neither was my graphics card
in my other computer. Anyway I went to the website of my graphics
card and they had a file to supposedly add support for my card to
linux but how do i go about installing it? It is gzipped and to
be honest I have no clue where I am or what I am doing once I get
logged in to linux without any of the window managers. I have
only had redhat about 3 days now:) Anyway I have the file I
supposedly need on a floppy, but dont have any idea what to do
with it now. Alos after I installed RedHat for some reason Win98
became EXTREMELY slow and is giving me probs and a lot of
programs not responding any idea why this is?<br>
Thanks for any and all help you can give me.<br>

Subject: VIRUSES on the Net !!!<br>
<br>
Many articles have been written in the press concerning the virus
&quot;I love You &quot; and similar one<br>
It would be appreciated to have a general article in the Linux
Gazette about the problem of viruses as many computers have both
Microsoft Windows and Linux installed . What are the protections
of Linux against virus intrusions ? What<br>
differentiates Microsoft OS from Linux concerning this problem?
Is it safe or reasonable to continue to use Microsoft Windows as
it costs so much to the community to get rid of these viruses? To
these financial worries one can add updating systems 95 Versions,
98, Millenium , plus WWW browser plus bugs plus plus.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>[I'm sure it's been said before, many, many times.
    But, just for the point of clarity, I'l say it again. Virii
    (viruses) are virtually a non-issue in Linux, especially
    those like the love bug. I myself have never expereinced that
    particular virus, but I've read about Linux users who have,
    and, after using a bit of common sense, I've come to the
    conclusion that it could not affect a Linux box. Why? The
    love bug is a Visual BASIC script designed to run on Windows
    computers. Under Linux, you could just download the script
    and read it, without it doing any damage to your system. Most
    virii will have little affect on Linux, most are
    Windows-centric, and only designed to run under the
    aforementioned GUI. There are virus scanners available for
    Linux, and true, there are Linux specific Virii. However, I
    wouldn't waste the time of the download if I was you - the
    odds of you getting one are -extremely low-. Thankyou, and
    goodnight. -Alex.]</em></p>

<P> Back when I ran NetBSD, there was a way I could mount (or link?) a directory
from a read-only medium (CD-ROM, NFS that I only have read permission for,
etc.) to a directory on my hard disk as read-write.  If I added a file
to the directory, it would be stored on my hd.  If I modified a file,
then it would save my version on my hd and transparently use that version
rather the version on the ro medium.  If I deleted a file, it stored
something locally so it knew to make it appear as if that file wasn't
there.

<P> Can I do this in Linux?  If so, how?

<BR>Subject: Linux Gazette - German translation

<P> Hi folks.

<P> I love the Linux Gazette, but the last time I think there are more and more
Linux users in Germany who didn't speak english (yes it's possible to use
Linux without speaking English. The SuSE does a very good translation) or have
really problems to speak it.
I think most of them want to learn a lot about Linux, but there are not so much
german-languaged Pages.
So I think if would be nice if there are some guys speaking english and german
very well who help me to translate the Linux Gazette.

<BR>Subject: SuSE Linux and Microsoft medialess OS

<P> Dear Linux Supporters:

<P> I have started playing around with SuSE Linux and am impressed with the
product. I have been a died in the wool Microsoft user for the last
eight years.  I have seen them step on a lot of folks and that is part
of business. I have also put up with their mindless CD keys that make  a
network administrators life miserable. Not copy protected is what it
said on all of their software. That was until they controlled the market
now everything is copy protected.

<P> But the latest rumor or plan that Microsoft has put me over the edge. I
read the an article in the May 1, 2000 issue of  INFO WORLD that
Microsoft now wants to jam a "medialess OS" down our throats.  The
article is entitled "Users find Microsoft's medialess anti piracy play
hard to swallow" explains their latest attempt to stop software piracy. 
 This is it for me. 

<P> I have been an ardent supporter up till this.  I want to convert to
something else. The problems are my word, access and other apps that use
MS apps.  Is there a way to continue to use these apps without Microsoft
OS. Or is there a way to emulate win apps or is there other apps that
transparently use their files?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>
<P> [Quoting from the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net/faq/index.html">LG FAQ</A>:

<P> The Gazette is too big to send via e-mail. Issue #44 is 754 KB;
the largest issue (#34) was 2.7 MB. Even the text-only version of #44 is
146 K compressed, 413 K uncompressed. If anybody wishes to distribute
the text version via e-mail, be my guest. There is an announcement
mailing list where I announce each issue; e-mail
lg-announce-request@ssc.com with "subscribe" in the message body to
subscribe. Or read the announcement on comp.os.linux.announce. 

<P> You'll have to either read the web version or download the FTP
files.  

<P> I asked our sysadmin whether we could set up a mailing list for the
</EM>Gazette<EM> issues themselves, and he was unwilling, again because of the
size issue.  Many mail transport systems are configured to reject messages
larger than 1 or 1.5 MB.  "And I don't want my sysadmin mailbox stuffed chock
full of bounced 4M emails."


</EM><H4>Note to mirrors:</H4><EM>
<P> We receive at least one request a month to send the </EM>Gazette<EM> via
e-mail.  So there is definitely reader demand for it.  If you wish to offer
</EM>Gazette<EM> via e-mail, you would need to send out the current issue's
FTP file along with <STRONG>lg-base-new</STRONG> (the changed shared files)
every month.  Users would somehow need access to <STRONG>lg-base</STRONG>
(all the shared files) when they subscribe and whenever they reinstall the
<STRONG>Gazette</STRONG>.  I don't know how you would handle changes to the
FTP files later (i.e., corrections to back issues).  -Ed.]
