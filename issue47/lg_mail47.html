<BR>Subject: Filename extensions for web program listings

<P> Hi, astute readers.  Your <I>Linux Gazette</I> editor has a question for
you.  With this issue, I've started moving program listings that are 
included in articles into their own separate text files, to make it 
easier for those who want to run the programs.

<P> My question is, which filename extensions are safe to use so that they'll
show up properly as text files in the browsers?  I'm wavering between using a
language-specific extension (.c, .sh, .pl, .py, etc.) vs putting .txt at the
end of all of them (or .sh.txt, etc.)  What about listings that don't have an
extension on the source file?  They display as text on my browser, but do they
display properly on yours?

<P> Language-specific extensions would be the most ideal, because they offer
the possibility of syntax highlighting if the browser supports it.  (Does
any browser support this?)  However, I know I've tried to view files on other
sites that I know perfectly well are text-readable, but the browser insists
on downloading them rather than viewing them because it doesn't recognize the
type.  (Of course, that's better than the corollary, where it tries to view
.tar.gz or .mp3 files as text.)  

<P> Of course, the ultimate answer is to fix your mailcap entry and MIME types,
but that can be tedious.  Also, the person viewing the site may not know how to
set the MIME types properly.

<P> So which is better: language-specific extensions, no extensions, or .txt?

<BR>Subject: Linux hangs when out of swap

<P> When running memory intensive problems, such as animate from ImageMagic or
General Mesh Viewer (GMV) out of Los Alamos Labs, and the swap space limit
is reached, Linux hangs. Only option is to power off the computer. This is
repeatable (sad to say it has been too often lately).

<P> This does it on the RedHat 6.0 and 5.2 releases. Is there a way to force
the application to abort and not the kernel when the swap limit is
reached?

<P> I am using the RedHat 6.0 on a PIII, 500 Mhz Intel computer
Linux 2.2.5-15 (root@porky) (gcc egcs-2.91.66)

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[Take a look at the ulimit command (built into bash and other shells).
	It tells the kernel not to let this process use more than X amount of
	resources.  I use "ulimit -c 0" to prevent core files from being
	created.  There are several options dealing with memory, although I
	haven't used them.  The most promising looks like -v, which sets "the
	maximum amount of virtual memory  available to the shell".

	<P> I have also had problems when the swap limit is reached, but not
	exactly like what you describe..  Unfortunately, Linux's otherwise
	excellent memory manager is not quite up to par in this situation.  The
	kernel is supposed to start killing processes when a critical stage is
	reached to free up some memory; however, sometimes that doesn't happen
	properly.

	<P> I had a situation happen while I was out of town where apache and
	squid zombied for no apparent reason, and there were no error messages
	in the syslog.  I restarted them (after clearing out the PID lock files
	so they would consent to restart) and they ran OK.  Then I realized
	syslog wasn't running, which was the reason I had gotten no error
	messages for the past day.  Then I noticed there were a whole lot of
	zombies, and when I tried to "kill -9" them, they remained.  "Update"
	(the daemon that flushes files to disk) was also a zombie.  Tried to
	run "shutdown", but it wouldn't do anything.  Tried switching runlevels,
	still didn't help.  Finally I realized init wasn't running!  How do you
	shut down the system when you can't run "shutdown"?  The old-fashioned
	way: close as many files as you can, run sync, press reset, and hope for
	the best.  When it came up again, I had lots of fsck errors, two
	lost+found files (fortunately non-critical), and all the files I had
	created or modified over the past day were unchanged.  Fortunately, the
	changes I had made to a text file two days before, which I had worked a
	whole day on, were still there.  When I asked people what could have
	caused this, the consensus seemed to be the system had probably run out
	of memory.  This is with kernel 2.2.10 on Debian.  Fortunately, the 
	problem has not repeated; and doubly fortunate, it didn't happen during
	the time I was away and had to log into the box remotely to check my
	e-mail; and triply fortunate, exim (in non-daemon mode) ran fine the
	whole time.  -Ed.]

	[I have a Toshiba Satellite 486-75, 16MB RAM, 500MB HD, and it has been
	running Linux for four years.

	<P> I would not recommend trying to install Linux on a 4MB machine if
	you're not familiar with Linux.  It would have to be done the
	"old-fashioned way", without the automatic installation utilities the
	current distributions have.  You would have to use an old kernel
	(perhaps from the 1.x series).  For your efforts you would get a server
	that could perhaps be used as a one-purpose dedicated server or as a
	dialout terminal, but that's it.

	<P> I used to work for an ISP where we used 386s (8MB RAM) and then 486s
	(16MB RAM) as routers.  The 386s worked fine with the then-current
	version of Slackware (this was 1996), although we upgraded the memory to
	16MB on the higher-traffic ones.  The worst problem was never knowing
	when the ancient hard drives would fail.  The 486s (1998) were much more
	reliable.

	<P> Linux is very scalable and can be used on a wide variety of
	machines, but of course some of its features aren't usable on lower-end
	machines.  You didn't say what capacity your desktop PC has.  I would
	consider 16MB a minimum amount of memory for a general-purpose machine
	that is not running X-windows, and 32 (or more) if you want to run
	Netscape or an office suite. -Ed.]

<BR>Subject: Looking for suggestions and ideas for a Linux-based class


<P> By way of introduction, I am a computer and networking instructor at Davis
Applied Technology Center (- the ATC's are Utah's equivalent of VoTech
schools.)  My original industry background is in *ix-networked mainframes,
LAN/WAN architecture, and in mixed-environment networks ( mixed, as in
putting *ix and MS in the same coherent network- I even went and got an
MCSE to certify in the MS half of it)

<P> Digression aside, this is my predicament:

<P> Having recently come on board as a instructor here at DATC, I had noticed
that the UNIX curriculum was way out of date, and had but a single small
class (they were still teaching an older version of SCO-Unix as the core
OS.)  I proposed to update it, and a deadline of January 2000 was set for
the basic course, March 2000 for the advanced/sysadmin level course
(though it should be done at about the same time as the basic course.)

<P> Currently, I have a basic course outlines (using Linux as the core OS),
and have found the textbooks for the courses (which I have split up into
basic *ix and advanced sysadmin-level *ix)

<P> My question to all of you in the industry is this: What parts of Linux,
and the networking of same, are most important to you? Should there be
more concentration in TCP/IP fundamentals (which I have included),
specific Linux/*ix-based programs ( KDE, Gnome, Apache), or which? What is
it that you most desire in an entry-level (or not-so-entry-level) employee
candidate?

<P> I do have a structure based on my own opinions, yes, but since our mandate
at DATC is to match industry needs, I wanted to get the widest base of
opinions possible.

<P> (An aside - I know that Red Hat is working to get a cert program together,
but until it gets in place fully (and until all the testing centers carry
it), I've got a curriculum to build.)

<P> Please feel free to send all of your ideas, suggestions, and a brief
description of why they should be implemented to me, here at tjmiller@datc.tec.ut.us  . Especially encouraged are those in the industry who hire
entry-level IT professionals. I would also appreciate a brief description
of what your company does in the industry, if you would be so kind.

<P> Hi,
 I'm looking for source code for the ls command on my Redhat (4.2)
CDROM under the SRPMS directory, but I can't find it anywhere. I
also did a 'find / -name ls* -print' of my system, and it found the
binary
but not the source file. Can you please tell me where it is? Thanks:)

	[It's part of a larger package.  I use Debian, so I would type: 
	<PRE>
	dpkg -S ls | grep bin/ls
	</PRE>
	(The grep is there because of the large numbers of hits
	on the bare substring "ls".)  This shows which package contains the
	file.  fileutils: /bin/ls See the rpm manpage; there should be an option
	that does a similar thing.  In any case, the package is probably called
	"fileutils" on RedHat too, since both distros got it from the same

<BR>Subject: su not working

<P> Hello.  I am writing because as of 2 weeks ago I have lost the ability to su
to root.  I can still log in as root.  I can also su from root to normal
users.  I am running Red Hat 6.0 with the kernel 2.2.5-15 on i686.  I am
currenly running a live Apache web server version 1.3.6.  I have been told
that the loss of the ability to su to root could be a sign of an intruder.
I am hoping this is not true.  I am further hoping that this is just some
setting that can adjusted to remedy this.  I am at a complete loss as what
to do I am hoping that you can help me with this.  If there is anyother
information that I have left off I apologize.  Thank you in advance

<P><STRONG><EM>The Editor wrote:</EM></STRONG>

<P> I don't have answers, but some possible strategies:

<P> 1) Check /etc/passwd (and /etc/shadow if it exists) for any users besides
root with UID 0.  These should probably be removed, or at least put an 
'x' or '*' or something at the beginning of the password so they can't log in.

<P> 2) Change your root password (and other passwords).

<P> 3) Check for all programs called "su" on the system.  Only one should 
exist, /bin/su.  The others could be trojan horses.  Do you get the
same behavior if you type "/bin/su" to run it rather than just "su"?

<P> 4) Reinstall the package containing /bin/su.  (shellutils?)

<P> 5) Read the man and/or info pages for su carefully: there may be a
configuration file somewhere that determines who can su.

<P> 6) What error message did you get?  Login incorrect?  Permission denied?
Forbidden to su root as this user or on this terminal?

<P> 7) Are you using shadow passwords?  There could be an inconsistency in
the password configuration: are all the passwords in /etc/passwd *'d
out?  Or is there a password in /etc/passwd that is different than 
/etc/shadow?  Shadow passwords are supposed to be an all-or-nothing
approach, but sometimes one gets inconsistencies in that some programs
(login, passwd, su, getty, adduser) use/modify the shadow file and 
others don't.  I would not expect this on a modern Red Hat installation,
though.  If you do notice a discrepency, all login/authentication
packages should be replaced, and have a boot floppy handy in case you
lock yourself out of your system.  

<P> 8) Are you using NIS?  This would add another layer of complexity which
I'm not qualified to comment on.


<P><STRONG><EM>Thomas wrote back:</EM></STRONG> 
<P> [parts of e-mail deleted]
<P> I can't find anything [in the su man page] except a mention of the wheel
group

<P> I get incorrect password...when it is the correct password
I have now determined that any su involving a password fails for the same
reason...incorrect password

<P> I am using shadow passwords.. I have found an inconsistency.  In passwd
there is one user named ken (as it should be)  however in shadow there is a
ken and a Ken(should not be a Ken).  So according to you I should replace
all the packages for login, which I have not done yet, nor am a sure how to
do.  Are they RPM's ( I hope)?

<P> No on the NIS


<P><STRONG><EM>The Editor responded:</EM></STRONG>
<P> If your system uses a wheel group, only people in the wheel group are
allowed to su root.  Add your username to the wheel group in /etc/groups.
You'll then need to log out and back in again.  Run the command "groups"
to see which groups you're in.

<P> /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow should not have any lines that aren't either
genuine users or the pseudo-users that came with the OS (audio, floppy, dip,
nogroup, users, etc) or installed by packages (majordom, news, irc, etc).
The pseudo-users normally have a password "*" to prevent anybody from 
logging in as them (except "news" perhaps if you have a news administrator
that needs to be user "news" to do administrative work).

<P> There should be RPMs for all the login-related programs.  Look through
the descriptions of packages on your CD and you should find them.
The shadow utilities will be in a separate package.

<P> I would fix any inconsistencies or unauthorized users in the passwd and 
shadow files first, and then reinstall the packages if things still aren't
working right.


<P><STRONG><EM>Thomas wrote again:</EM></STRONG> 
<P> I really appreciate all your advice.  I have found the problem.  Apparently
the rights to /bin/su were set to
<CODE>rwxr-xr-x</CODE> instead of <CODE>rsxr-xr-x</CODE>.  I feel really stupid
for overlooking such a thing.  I still don't know how it got changed.  I am
guessing that it was not an intruder, I cannot see a motive to do such a
thing...but who knows.  I still have that strange user that did not belong.  I
just edited him out of shadow.  Once again thanks.


<P><STRONG><EM>The Editor lamented:</EM></STRONG>
<P> Ach, I didn't even think about that.


<P><STRONG><EM>Thomas added:</EM></STRONG> 
<P> Probably not worth printing anymore huh.  Once again thanks.  If you ever
have any thoughts on how that extra user got into shadow feel free to let me
know.<BR>
Thomas

<P><STRONG><EM>The Editor concluded:</EM></STRONG>
<P> Regarding the unknown user:  considering it's your own name, it may be that
you typed it that way at some prompt during the initial installation.

<P> Regarding the e-mails: they're still worth printing because they may help
somebody else.

works with DOS and/or Macintosh as well as Windows, it should work.  I use the
US Robotics Sportster, but modems have standardized enough now that they should
be pretty interchangeable.  External modems are easier to configure than
internal ones, because you have the status lights to tell you what the modem is
doing, and you don't have to muck about with Plug-n-Delay or whether another
device (a serial port?) is using the IRQ.  Some people also suggest external
modems are better because the heat they generate belongs outside the computer
case.

<BR>Subject: mail bag q: 1-way cable modem woes

<P> 6 days of scouring the mini-HOWTO, the web, deja, the linux-net archives,
and trying every imaginable route(8) configuration have left me nothing
short of frustrated...

<P> I just got a new com21 from Prime Cable in Chicago, which, of course,
"doesn't fully support" anything but win95/98/nt (which, of course, it
works fine under).  Of course, I'd much prefer to have it up on the linux
box, so all the machines can use it (currently 3-5 machiens share a 28.8
connection- ugh!).

<P> They give you a username/pw, a number to dial into w/ a regular modem, and
have you set up the ethernet as 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.240.

<P> I can dial in ok, ping other machines on the same subnet (which come back
over ppp0), etc.  Problem is, the only thing I get on eth1 are arp who-has
packets and pings from 10.0.0.14 (which I'm guessing is their router) to
other hosts on the subnet.

<P> I'm running debian potato w/ a fresh 2.2.13 kernel & just about every
networking option compiled in.  I've disabled ipchains & eth0 (internal
lan) until I can get this thing working.  I've tried every set of ifconfig
& route commands I could think of, & still nothing.

<P> If anyone out there has a similar cable/ppp setup, the outputs of
'ifconfig' and 'route -n' would be of immense help (all I've been able to
find are RH sysconfig examples), as well as anything unusual (special ppp
hacks, kernel modules, etc.) that was necessary to get it to work.

<P> Any help greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

<P> i'll really very glad  if you can send me some more questions like this.
smita



<P> <STRONG><EM>The Editor asked:</EM></STRONG>
<P> To suggest techniques, we'd need to know what the goal is.  Why would
people be testing open-source software?  What would they be looking for?
Bugs?  How well the program functions compared to a similar closed-
source program?

<P> Open-source programs are usually tested by their developers and some
of their users --- in other words, by the people who need the programs
to function correctly.  There is frequently some kind of informal
organization of volunteers which accepts bug reports and ensures they
are followed up on.

<P> Organizations such as Linux distributions that don't write a lot of
software themselves but instead repackage other people's software, will
also do their own testing, to ensure the program conforms to the
standard the distribution has set for all their packages.  For instance,
the Debian distribution follows the Linux Filesystem Standard, which
specifies that configuration and data files and belong in certain
directories.  The distribution maintainers may modify the program
slightly to make it confirm to this rule, then test it to ensure it
does.  The distribution receives bug reports both about its own errors
(which it fixes itself) and errors regarding the program's internals
(which it forwards to the program's own development team).

<P> Is this the kind of testing you're talking about?  If so, your best
bet would be to talk with developers of open-source programs.  They
can tell you how their particular programs are tested, which should 
give you an idea how open-source programs in general are tested.

<P> I talked to Jay Green at the Seattle Times about the Microsoft Linux web
page.  He felt, as I did, that Microsoft just doesn't know how to
"control" Linux because they can't just buy it.

<P> He pointed me to a web page on the Microsoft trial.  He was at the
particular event I am including below.  He said it was the best commercial
he had heard for Linux in general and specifically Caldera Linux.  The guy
presenting works for Microsoft.


<P> (From <A HREF=http://microsoft.com/presspass/trial/transcripts/jan99/01-25-pm.htm>
microsoft.com/presspass/trial/transcripts/jan99/01-25-pm.htm</A>)

<P>     "HELLO.  MY NAME IS VINOD VALLOPPIL, AND I'M
A PROGRAM MANAGER IN THE PERSONA AND BUSINESS
SYSTEMS GROUP AT MICROSOFT.  THIS IS A
DEMONSTRATION OF THE CALDERA OPENLINUX OPERATING
SYSTEM, A NON-MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEM FOR
PERSONAL COMPUTERS.  THE DEMONSTRATION WILL SHOW
THAT CALDERA'S OPERATING SYSTEM PROVIDES
EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONALITY FOR TYPICAL END USERS.

<P>     I HAVE INSTALLED A COPY OF CALDERA'S
OPERATING SYSTEM ON THIS STANDARD PERSONAL
COMPUTER AND ACCEPTED ALL DEFAULT SETTINGS A
WELL AS INSTALLED A SET OF END-USER APPLICATIONS
BUNDLED WITH CALDERA'S OPERATING SYSTEM.

<P>     I'M CURRENTLY DEMONSTRATING CALDERA'S
OPERATING SYSTEMS' GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE.  THE
GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE, OR GUI FOR SHORT, AS
PROVIDED BY CALDERA TO INSURE THAT THE OPERATING
SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND IS COMPETITIVE WITH
MICROSOFT'S WINDOWS OFFERING.

<P>     A QUICK TOUR OF THE SCREEN DEMONSTRATES THAT
IN MANY RESPECTS, CALDERA'S OPERATING SYSTEM
LOOKS JUST LIKE MICROSOFT WINDOWS.  CALDERA'S
OPERATING SYSTEM HAD A START MENU AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE SCREEN LISTING INSTALLED PROGRAMS AND
MAKING IT VERY EASY TO SELECT AND RUN THESE
PROGRAMS; A TASK BAR AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN
LISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING ON
THE COMPUTER; AND FINALLY, AN ARRAY OF ICONS ON
THE UPPER LEFT PORTION OF THE SCREEN PROVIDING
USERS A QUICK WAY TO RUN PROGRAMS OR ACCESS
INFORMATION ON THEIR HARD DISK.

<P>     LIKE MICROSOFT WINDOWS, CALDERA'S OPERATING
SYSTEM PROVIDES A SERIES OF ACCESSORY
APPLICATIONS FOR CONSUMERS' DAILY ACTIVITIES SUCH
AS EDITING DOCUMENTS AND WRITING E-MAIL.  FOR
EXAMPLE, I WILL EDIT A QUICK DOCUMENT, TYPIN
`THIS IS A TEST.'

<P>     I WILL ALSO CREATE A QUICK SAMPLE E-MAIL
MESSAGE.

<P>     CALDERA'S OPERATING SYSTEM HAS A GROWING
LIST OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SUPPORT AND
CORPORATE BACKING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
COMPANIES SUCH AS NETSCAPE, INTEL, ORACLE, SUN,
AND IBM.

<P>     IN ORDER TO CREATE A MORE COMPETITIVE
OFFERING TO WINDOWS, CALDERA'S OPENLINUX
OPERATING SYSTEM, IN PARTICULAR, BUNDLES A NUMBER
OF THESE THIRD-PARTY PROGRAMS.

<P>     A CRITICAL CLASS OF APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE
VERY POPULAR WITH CUSTOMERS IS THE OFFICE
PRODUCTIVITY SUITE.  MICROSOFT'S OFFERING IN THIS
CATEGORY IS MICROSOFT OFFICE.  OTHER COMPETITORS
TO MICROSOFT OFFICE WHO BUILD ON THE WINDOWS
PLATFORM INCLUDE COREL, IBM, AND STAR DIVISION OF
GERMANY.

<P>     CALDERA'S BUNDLES STAR DIVISION'S
PRODUCTIVITY SUITE WITH THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM.
IN THIS CASE, I HAVE STAR OFFICE FOR CALDERA'S
OPERATING SYSTEM ON SCREEN.  LIKE MICROSOFT'S
POPULAR OFFICE SUITE, STAR OFFICE PROVIDES AN
INTEGRATED SUITE OF APPLICATIONS INCLUDING WOR
PROCESSING LIKE MICROSOFT WORD, A SPREADSHEET
PROGRAM LIKE MICROSOFT EXCEL, AND A PRESENTATION
GRAPHICS PROGRAM LIKE MICROSOFT'S POWERPOINT.

<P>     STAR OFFICES'S APPLICATIONS IN THIS CATEGORY
NOT ONLY PROVIDE FULL-FEATURED PRODUCTS, BUT
THEY'RE ALSO INTEROPERABLE WITH POPULAR WINDOWS
PRODUCTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, I WILL NOW IMPORT A
RICHLY FORMATTED DOCUMENT CREATED IN MICROSOFT
WORD INTO STAR OFFICE RUNNING ON CALDERA'S
OPERATING SYSTEM.  NOTICE THAT NOT ONLY THE TEXT
OF THE DOCUMENT WAS ABLE TO BE IMPORTED INTO STAR
OFFICE, BUT ALSO FEATURES SUCH AS RICHLY
FORMATTED SECTION HEADINGS--IN THIS CASE, THE
BLUE BOLD-FACED TEXT WITH THE LINE ABOVE IT--AND
EMBEDDED GRAPHICS, THE CIRCLE WITH THE WORD
"PRINTER" INSIDE OF IT.

<P>     LIKE CALDERA'S GRAPHICAL INTERFACE, STAR
OFFICE ALSO BENEFITS STRONGLY FROM CUSTOMERS'
EXPERIENCE WITH MICROSOFT PRODUCTS.  THE STAR
OFFICE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE,
AND WORK LIKE, MICROSOFT OFFICE.  AS JUST ONE
EXAMPLE, DOCUMENT FORMATTING FEATURES SUCH AS
BOLD-FACE TYPE, UNDERLINE TYPE, AND ITALICS ARE
QUICKLY AND EASILY AVAILABLE TO THE END USER WITH
JUST A SINGLE MOUSE CLICK ON BUTTONS THAT LOO
VERY MUCH LIKE AND ARE LOCATED ON A TOOLBAR JUST
LIKE THE BUTTONS THAT PROVIDE THESE FEATURES IN

<P>     IN SUMMARY, I HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT
CALDERA'S OPERATING SYSTEM IS:  FIRST, POWERFUL
AND EASY TO USE; SECOND, THAT THERE ARE
SIGNIFICANT THIRD-PARTY SUPPORT IN BOTH SOFTWARE
AND HARDWARE COMPANIES; AND FINALLY, THAT
CALDERA'S PRODUCT BUNDLES A STRONG OFFICE
PRODUCTIVITY SUITE FROM STAR DIVISION WHICH IS
NOT ONLY INTEROPERABLE WITH MICROSOFT PRODUCTS,
BUT IS ALSO DESIGNED TO WORK AND LOOK LIKE
MICROSOFT PRODUCTS SO THAT USERS OF THESE
PRODUCTS WILL BE COMFORTABLE AND PRODUCTIVE USING
THESE PROGRAMS.

<P>     THIS CONCLUDES THE DEMONSTRATION OF CALDERA
OPENLINUX OPERATING SYSTEM VERSION 1.3."

<BR>Subject: redhat in pirated China

<P> Although legitimate software vendors sell Linux in China, the price is much
higher than that of pirated CD-ROM vendors. These vendors are major source
of software for Chinese. (Yes piracy rate is very high.) They play
cat-mouse game with the government agency. No matter it is Win98, NT, VC or
freeware, the price is the same: 10 yuan or 1.2 US$ each CD.

<P> Because of the underground nature of these vendors, they dishonestly label
the CD-ROMs. Here redhat is dominant in Linux category. In fact the makers
are so preoccupied with redhat that they describe FreeBSD as "in a redhat
series". Although the new redhat version is 6.0, they have 6.5. I don't
care because the "6.5" CD is an authentic 6.0. And I understand why they
label them that way: they have already sold "6.0", "5.5" redhat CD,
which actually are variations of 5.1 or 5.2. One "5.5" redhat CD
description proudly claims that it is "completely cracked". I do notice
that 5.2 installer select some Chinese tools by default. But I am very
unhappy because Netscape can't run. I realize much later that the file size
is incorrect although it could be installed. Recently "6.51" has come to
the shelf. It has 2 CDs. The 2nd one has StarOffice, Oracle and DB2. I
wonder when RedHat could make a official presence here. But would that
help? The official redhat CD is 50 US$. It can't beat 1.2 US$.

<P> Hi there!
	I read your magazine and I think it's great. I've picked up quite a few
tips from the Answer Guy and I really like his column. But...

<P>	I'd really like to see a separate index page for the Answer Guy with
links to all his stuff in all the issues organized by subject. It would
make it a lot easier to find articles on specific topics. Heck, it might
even make an interesting book when enough information has been gathered.
	If you would consider this, I'd be most grateful. Thanks for a great
magazine!

<BR>Subject: Gazette issue 44 AND Netscape

<P> Hi,

<P> Could you tell me a reason why Netscape 4.06 suffers indigestion when I
ask it to browse my downloaded copy of the HTML version of LG 44?

<P> The system is a 486 with 32Mb RAM, running RedHat 5.1 with a 2.0.35 kernel.
Netscape reads 34% of the file, then stops.The Netscape process (I should say
processes, because there seem to be two) still occupies memory, but no longer
consumes clock cycles according to top.  Nothing on the page responds to mouse
or keyboard, and the page doesn't re-draw if you drag another window across it.

<P> There is still plenty of swap space available - is it possible that Netscape
doesn't "know" how to use it?

<P> Issues 43 &amp; 45 behave themselves.  A rational explanation would be
welcome, and a cure even more so!   I have studied the offerings of the
Netscape site, but nothing I read there seems quite to fit these symptoms.

<P> Dear sir,
    I use Redhat 5.1 with Netscape 4.05 (or4.02? whatever the default
is) and I have the same problem mentioned in your recent edition of
having the full page HTML load only about half on your Linux Gazette
home page. In a test of this issue I only got about to the "Linux and
the future" article by Husain Al-Mohssen about to the middle of the
second paragraph with a file size of roughly 299535. Lately I have taken
to reading the gzipped text files especially as I can read them offline
but thought I would mention this problem since apparently someone else
has this problem.
    As to the size I was routinely able to read transcripts of the
MS-DOJ depositions up to about 400KB with no problems (except those
apparently on their end and not related to size at all)

<P> Sincerely,

<P> Doug Dahl

<BR>Subject: Linux Is Not For You

<P> Bravo to Mr. Nod for his article 
<A HREF=../issue46/nod.html>Linux Is Not For You</A> in issue 46. I too
am going through the growing pains of using LINUX for the first time.  My
cousin, a big time UNIX systems engineer, wants me to do a little project
for him.  He has an accounting program written in DBaseIII that he wants
ported to PostgreSQL.  This sounds feasible, and I should have the requisite
knowledge since I earn a living as a SQL Server and Oracle DBA and an NT
systems administrator.  A database is a database and SQL is mostly SQL.  How
hard could it be?

<P> I added a third computer to my home NT network and attempted to install
LINUX.  The installation may have been successful, I will never know because
when faced with the dot prompt, I didn't know what to do.  None of the DOS
commands or even the old RTE commands I could think of would work, so I
turned it off.  My cousin took the machine to his house and got it running
on his network.  He even put a little 'red hat' sticker on it. He tried to
explain why it was necessary to set up a partition for the kernel and a
partition for the swap file and a working partition and so on and then
handed me a book about the size of a Manhattan phone directory that was
supposed to explain everything.  I stuck the computer on my home network and
fired it up.    It promptly froze up.  Since I couldn't get it to do
anything, I turned it off.  "Worst thing you could do" he told me when I
called the next day when it wouldn't boot up.

<P> I installed another release of Red Hat 6 I had ordered from an online
auction.  It installed immediately and to my great joy even had a
desktop-like interface complete with a start button.  This looks great, but
I still can't make it do much.  At least the mouse works.  The next weekend
he visited my house, and got the computer to see the network.  Even he was
not willing to try and get the printer to work over the network, and instead
brought a nice HP print sharing device.  I asked about installing PostgreSQL
and he assured me it was easy.  "Just mount the CD and install the RPMs" he
tells me.  RIGHT!

<P> LINUX People, I am really trying hard, but I agree with nod.  LINUX is NOT
user friendly.  Now I know all of you true believers are thinking "What a
Wimp, you should have seen how hard it was back at release 2".  I do know
that I could have taken a brand new computer virgin and had them somewhat
productive in an NT-SQL Server environment in the time I have spent just
trying to learn to copy a file and mount a drive.  I still have not been
able to start with my conversion project since I don't have a database I can
talk to yet.  I realize that if I had been brought up in a UNIX environment,
this stuff would be second nature by now, but I wasn't.  I still haven't had
the nerve to shut the damn computer down again, because I hate to have my
cousin make the hour drive over to get it started again.

<P> I am going to keep working at it, but right now I think the motto "You get
what you pay for" is true.

	[Thanks for your letter.  It was exceptionally well written.

	<P> Those of us who are tekkies need to keep in contact with people who
	are new at Linux, in order to get it to the point of being
	user-friendly.  But we also tend to believe that the more you puts into
	learning how your OS works (any OS), the more you will get out of it.

	<P> #BEGIN "rant" {<BR>
	MS and some other OS companies unfortunately does not encourage people
	to do this.  In fact, they actively discourage it.  Both at a marketing
	level ("You don't need to know anything about this computer; just plug
	it in and it will work." [which is of course a big lie for any OS]; "You
	don't need special training to become an NT administrator, unlike
	UNIX."), and at a technical level (it's hard to tell what Windows is
	doing behind the scenes when it boots, or why it crashed, and what to do
	if those configuration dialogs don't have the options you need), and
	also at the legal level ("Reverse-engineer this and we'll sue you.")
	This may be fine for an embedded appliance, but it seriously limits
	one's ability to use one's computer at its potential, or to fix it
	yourself if it goes bust.

	<P> My dad always used to say, "Why can't a computer be like a car?  All
	cars have a steering wheel that works the same, ditto for the clutch and
	gearshift."  The trouble is, we only ask a car to do one thing: go
	somewhere.  Running the myriad of applications we expect from a computer
	is a whole different ballgame.  Plus, the computer industry isn't nearly
	mature enough to come to the level of standardization that cars have.
	Macs have a different keyboard and user interface than PCs because
	somebody though it would "work better".  There is not enough agreement
	on what the ideal user interface should be.<BR>

<BR>Subject: Linux is not for you


<P>    Dear nod,
   
<P>    Ouch ! Harsh blow ...
           I have just read that article you wrote in Linux Gazette
   (issue 46 - '1999/10) about Linux.
           So, let me introduce myself as well.
   I am technically a Linux/Unix technical-savvy ; by business need, a
   buggy-Windows user. And i very much dislike what you wrote, except for
   one single thing : this is just true. You really insulted the Linux
   community, but just by speaking common sense.
   
<P>    Linux developpers tend to think that a sane product is enough. But it
   is like food. You can spend time preparing a good and sane traditional
   european or asian (say french or japanese) meal, and take your time to
   savour it. Or you just can go to those unsane, too fat, pre-digested
   tasteless (say McDo or 'fish and chips') fastfood. Everybody knows
   what is good for one's health. But everyone runs into the place where
   you can fill up your belly instantly.  Same is true for using
   computer. Microsoft sells shit. But more people can use it nearly
   right-out-of-the-box. Linux guys make things that work, while
   Microsoft sells stuff that is somewhat usable. You are right when you
   tell that Linux guys should study the other camp's strengthes and
   weaknesses.
<P>           Nevertheless, you are wrong when you say that Windows is
   slower than Linux. This may be true in your example, but Linux does
   not spend so much time managing an intuitive interface. Stability
   always have a performance penalty. Having Windows much stabler would
   make it much slower, because that would mean the OS spend some time
   monitoring itself, preventing its own crashes by auto-repairing at
   run-time, like those big companies' giant mainframe computers (or
   phone ompanies switches) do (Alcatel switches' OS can spend up to 65%
   of their time preventing a crash, because if this happens, that could
   stop thousands of active communications, and guess why MVS is as big
   as NT 4.0 with just a tiny subset of its functionnality, no graphical;
   interface, ...).
<P>           Yet, globally, you expressed what i have been thinking for
   some years now : Unix or Linux are bound to disappear if they just
   concentrate on their strengthes, and do not try at the same time to
   outperform Microsoft's skills. Something that can be done. NeXTStep,
   eight years ago was superior to what Windows95 was seven years later.
   But NeXT was a small company in a market already overwhelmed with Bill
   Gates financial power. A commercial newcomer could not breathe in such
   rarefied market. Free software can. If free software does not really
   try to compete, then some Japanese commercial corporation are the only
   ones that can fight Microsoft. Sega, Nintendo and Sony have begun
   development that will turn their play console into consoles that will
   actually marginally be used to play. Thoses devices will be build
   around the Net, so they will manage documents. Then, what else all
   their computing power could be used for, apart for creating, editing,
   those, managing your mail, calendar and contacts ? And those
   corporation do know how to make consumer products. Even Windows is not
   such a product, because you yourself stated that people needed your
   help to sort out the mess that sometimes occur.
<P>           Their was the huge stable mainframes, then lighter
   minicomputers, then microcomputers. All professional-world-rooted
   devices. Microsoft pushes the enveloppe against those with Windows2000
   (formally NT), a product that explodes in market shares. But next is
   everybody's information device. This is the consumer market. The one
   that counts. Microsoft is already here with WindowsCE, but prepares
   the true attack with its yet- to-come XStation (a Microsoft machine
   !). The competitors are rare : three Japanese ... and no one else.
<P>         Where is Linux ? Linux claims for World domination. World
   domination means dominating both markets : the end-user device and the
   remaining of the infrastructure. As history tells, dominating the
   end-device helps dominating the rest of the infrastucture, just
   because it makes so many more people mastering the technology (even if
   it is comparatively less limited in terms of functionality), and then
   so much more skilled technicians on the job market. Only exceptions
   are surviving old dinosaurus IBM and certainly Microsoft in the
   future. Unix mini-systems greatly reduced the mainframes number by
   infiltering them credibly through Amdahl mainframes, and relegating
   them to niche markets (namely big corporations' strategic central data
   centers). Windows has come the same way from all those desktops, and
   now making its way into the infrastructure markets (servers,
   superservers, routers, datamarts, etc.), restricting Unix to niche
   markets itself (scientific calculators, and high-end database servers)
   and FreeBSD and Linux to their proof-of-concept market (mainkly
   Internet servers and firewalls in corporations that are big enough to
   justify the hiring of Linux-knowlegeable people). So now you see why
   Microsoft has invested less money in Windows during the last three or
   four years than it invested in WindowsCE,  interactive TV, now in play
   consoles, and more generally around consumer markets. You also see why
   Sega, Nintendo and Sony are to be looked at. Their products are to
   this date poor in terms of information features, but they are
   extremely powerful in processing power, and designed from the very
   first line to be bug-free.
   
<P>    If Linux wants to count in the future, the Linux community must take
   this into account : not look at what already exists or is advertised
   by Bill Gates, but anticipate what is next.
<P>    Remember the car industry. First there was those who designed
   their own car from scratch, starting in France,around the end of
   XVIIth century (as computer OS pioneers did). Then, end of XIXth
   century, those who build their cars from standard pieces, but had to
   turn dozens switches on (the fuel valve, the battery, the generator,
   the contactor), and then turn vigourously the to start it (as
   mainframe/Unix/Linux users do), then those who bought partially
   assembled car kits, with pieces bought from several providers (as
   Windows users do). Then there were the ones who bought cars you just
   had to climb into and turn on the key to use them, because Ford
   brought that in the first quarter of the century. The latter category
   now accounts for, say, 99.9 % of car-buyers.
<P>           I guess one day, you will buy your computer, turn it on, feed
   it with your name, e-mail address, ISP number (or transfering them in
   a one-keystroke operation from your old machine along with your diary,
   address book, documents), and start using it, without having to deal
   with LILO, sendmail, PPP account, and others' idiosyncrases. That day
   is just around the corner. With or Without Linux.
<P>           Is the community at work making Linux ready ? Or will we
   satisfy ourselves with Linux remaining in its getting-surrounded
   computer techies niche ?
