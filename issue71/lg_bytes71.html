<p><hr><p>
<!-- =================================================================== -->
<center><H3><font color="green">Legislation and More Legislation</font></H3></center>

<P> <STRONG>Behold the debut of a new News Bytes section.</STRONG>

<P> This is the third month in
a row that the legal landscape surrounding Linux users and programmers has
been rapidly changing.  We want to give adequate coverage to these
changes--new laws and proposed laws--around the world.  Since we have
personal knowledge only of the US and Ireland, we'll need readers to <A
HREF="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net">tell us</A> what's happening in their
countries.  This is important because anything that gets enacted in one
country is often held up as an example to encourage similar legislation in
other countries.  

<P> For any new law, one must ask:  Who is pushing it?  What will they
gain?  Who will lose under it (re fines or jail time)?  Why?  Do the
proponents have a secret agenda to use the law in ways the legislature
didn't intend?  Do they have a not-so-secret agenda to push for bigger laws
after this one is passed and accepted by the public?  What unintended
effects will the law have that even its proponents did not predict?
We can't answer all these, but hopefully we can start asking the questions.

<P> Especially the last question.  This section is partly an Ode to the Law
of Unintended Effects, because there are so many of them recently.  

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%"> <!-- ********************************* -->

LG reported in <A HREF="../issue69/orr.html">July</A>
and <A HREF="../issue70/lg_bytes70.html#dmca">August</A> about
the unexpected fallout from the
<STRONG>Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA)</STRONG>.
Companies are using it to suppress criticism of their shoddy designs,
prevent customers from protecting themselves from the effects
of said shoddy designs, and even jail a foreign programmer for writing (in
his home country) a program that is legal in his home country.  Now that 
Dmitry is facing a possible sentance of 25 years, I guess a decline in
corporate profits is more serious than armed robberies--even if the decline
in profits is hypothetical or imagined.  (Didja notice how in spite of
Napster, Gnutella and DeCSS, the sales of CDs and DVDs continue to go
nowhere but up?)

<P> Foreign programmers like Alan Cox (#2 Linux kernel developer and former
Usenix coordinator) are <A
HREF="http://lwn.net/2001/0726/letters.php3">avoiding the US</A> in order not
to fall into the same trap Dmitry did.
American programmers are
<A HREF="http://noframes.linuxjournal.com/articles/misc/0048.html#effects">
looking for jobs elsewhere</A> -- anywhere -- now that
normal and necessary practices in security development and security
certification are illegal.  Not that there may be many
places to go: the major proponents of the DMCA (the five biggest
media-publishing and software-publishing conglomorates) are using the 
established US law as an example to push for similar laws in Canada, Europe
and the FTAA (a possible future free-trade zone covering North and South
America), saying: "See, they did it, so you should too."

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">  <!-- **************** -->

In September, change went from "high gear" to "extremely
high gear" and then into "overdrive".  The Big 5 publishers came back with an
even sweeter proposal, the son of DMCA.  Aiming to plug the "loopholes" in 
the DMCA (meaning the last bit of fair use the DMCA allows), the
<STRONG>Security Systems Standards and Certification Act</A> (SSSCA)</STRONG>
<A HREF="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/hollings.090701.html">[draft
text]</A> 
<A HREF="http://cryptome.org/sssca.htm">[another draft]</A> would make it
illegal to "manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide or otherwise
traffic in any interactive digital device that does not include and utilize
certified security technologies that adhere to the security systems standards
adopted under section 104." 

<P> "Security systems standards" means software that
enforces digital copyrights.  Remember 
<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/17009.html">
CRPM</A>, the aborted effort to put
non-bypassable rights management into the firmware of all new IDE hard
drives?  That was scrapped because too many customers would refuse to buy
such products.  But SSSCA would make this or the equivalent mandatory.  

<P> Linux Weekly News <A HREF="http://lwn.net/2001/0913">writes</A>,
"The definition of a 'digital device' is just as broad as it sounds -
essentially, anything--hardware or software--that is capable of moving
and storing bits.  In particular, a computer running Linux is certainly
such a digital device, as is Linux itself or any of a number of other
free programs."  Free-software advocates are concerned, because is it
even <EM>possible</EM> for Linux to be compliant?  Linus could implement some
rights-management code in the kernel, but because it's open source, any
programmer could just comment it out.  And the companies would presumably
want to keep their (shoddy?) rights algorithm secret, so it would be
available only in binary form.  Would they even make a Linux version?  If
they did, would Linus have to link a proprietary, binary-only library into
the standard kernel and change Linux's license to allow and mandate this?
Would the kernel have a new module "digirights.o" with the help text, "If
you are outside the United States, choose 'N' for maximum flexibility,
reliability, speed and security.  If you are inside the US, be aware that
choosing 'N' may be a felony, and you should consult a lawyer before
proceeding."

<P> Another problem is that the technical standard is to be determined by
"representatives of interactive digital device manufacturers and
representatives of copyright owners".  What about representatives of the
public?  The constitutional right of copyright is a balance between the
author's interests (payment) and the public's interests (the "progress of
science and useful arts" by having everything become public domain after a
limited time, and fair-use rights in the meantime).  But this law is 
one-sided in favor not even of the authors, but of the big publishing houses.

<P> There is also a certain antitrust exemption in the bill.

<P> One concession to fair use remains: TV time-shifting.  People will be
allowed to record a TV show if it's an "over-the-air broadcast, non-premium
cable channel or non-premium satellite channel".  Recording a Showtime movie
would become illegal since it's on a premium cable channel.  Note that there's
no provision for radio, webcasting or future technologies, so there would be no
fair use at all for those.

<P> The SSSCA is not law yet.  In fact, as of early September it had not
even been introduced in Congress, just debated informally.  More happened
later, but let's keep things chronological....

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%"> <!-- ********************* -->

On September 11, the tragedy heard round the world.  This has been
well reported elsewhere, so I will stick to the issues relating to Linux.
Suddenly, <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,46816,00.html">
crypto back doors</A> and crypto export limitations are fashionable
again.  Congress is falling over itself trying to pass anti-terrorism
legislation as quickly as possible.  Some of this legislation is good and 
necessary.  But lobbying groups and government agencies are finding a rare
window of opportunity to sneak long-desired unrelated topics into the
package, and they are not shy about exploiting it.  It's a lobbyist's dream as
Congress is in a spending mood and eager to pass any legislation that purports
to hinder terrorism, without enough time to evaluate whether the actual effects
will be good or bad.

<P> Of course, there are the usual arguments against <STRONG>encryption back 
doors</STRONG>:
<UL>
<LI> If encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have encryption.
<LI> You want we should destroy our freedom in order to save it?
<LI> Even if our government and allied governments are good now, what if
one of them becomes bad?  How will we invalidate the keys it holds, especially
for old messages in a fixed (unchangeable) format?
<LI> What about rogue employees in the government or keyholding service?
Especially those who might sell the information to marketers, or use it for
identity theft to raise $$ for their meth fix?
<LI> E-commerce will decline because nobody wants to trust their personal 
information to something with a back door.
<LI> Strong encryption will continue to be developed overseas.  Our competitors
and enemies will have an advantage.
<LI> Skilled tech workers will vote with their feet and move to countries where
they can work on projects unencumbered by restrictions.
<LI> Exports will decline because foreigners will laugh at the security of
American encryption products.
</UL>

<P> Exactly one week after the terror attacks, the Nimda worm/virus
appeared, the son of Code Red.  The Justice Department 
<A HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/news/257">included</A> in
its Anti-Terrorism Act language that would <STRONG>define hackers,
virus-writers and web site defacers as "terrorists", eligible for life
imprisonment without parole.</STRONG>  "Cracking a computer for the purpose of
obtaining anything of value, or to deliberately cause damage" would carry the
same penalties as assassinating a public official or dropping a chemical 
weapon.  The law would be retroactive to the beginning of time, so even 
crimes committed long ago could be tried under it.  Fortunately for Kevin
Mitnick, he's already received his sentance.  But those who break into a
grocery store's web site and order a pack of gum for free had better watch
out.  And those who provide "'advice or assistance' to cyber crooks, or 
harbor or conceal a computer intruder" would receive the same punishment as
the intruders themselves.  "DNA samples would be collected from hackers upon
conviction, and retroactively from those currently in custody or under
federal supervision. The samples would go into the federal database that
currently catalogs murderers and kidnappers."

<P> What happens if you cross an Anti-Terrorism Act with a Digital Millenium
Copyright Act?  Answer: Dmitry goes to prison for life.  No, that hasn't been
proposed.  But watch out for that definition of "hacking" and see what
exactly it includes, and whether it expands later.  Remember the law of
Unintended Effects.

<P> Larry Ellison, the head of Oracle, is 
<A HREF="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/news/svfront/ellsn092301.htm">
calling for</A> <STRONG>national ID cards</STRONG>.  This may sound like
merely the musings of a concerned citizen until you remember that an ID-card
system needs a database, and why not an Oracle database?  Ellison is offering
to give the government the software for free, but still, what a PR bonanza for
Oracle it would be.  (Like when Microsoft "gives" software to schools.  Of
course, nowadays it "sells" software to schools....)  Regarding identity cards
themselves <A
HREF="http://www.privacy.org/pi/activities/idcard/idcard_faq.html"> this
report</A> looks at countries that use them and countries that don't use them,
and notes the differences between what each country originially intended its
card for vs how it's being used now.  (Again, the Law of Unintended Effects.)

<P> There is one bright side: Congress is considering splitting up the 
omnibus Anti-Terrorism bill.  That would allow it to pass the most urgent
portions right away, but hold off on the more controversial measures until
they can ascertain which ones would cause more harm than good.

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">  <!-- ******************************* -->

<P> In late September, the <STRONG>SSSCA</STRONG> was introduced in the
Senate.  It has a long way to go before it becomes law, since it has not even
been introduced in the House yet.  Most are predicting it has too many
critics to pass this year, but portions of it could crop up in future years.

<P> <I>Linux Journal's</I> Don Marti <A
HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/articles/conversations/0034.html">chided
Michael Eisner</A>, the Charman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company, for
planning a trip to Washington, DC, to "close the deal on a computer
censorship bill, the SSSCA, you're buying from Congress."  He also 
chided Senator Fritz Hollings (D-SC) under the headline, <A
HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/articles/conversations/0036.html">
"Senator Hollings Cheaper Than We Thought"</A>, saying that Eisner had paid
Hollings $18,500 to
get the bill introduced.  (And not the $25,000 <I>LJ</I> had previously
reported.)  Of course, the payment was in the form of
cumulative campaign contributions, not a direct bill payment (pun intended).  

<P> The Register notes in <A
HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/21830.html">
"Copy-Control Senator Sleeps While Fair-Use Rights Burn"</A> that the Big 5
media companies are among the top 20 contributors to Hollings' election
campaigns: AOL Time Warner, the Murdoch-owned News Corporation, Viacom's CBS,
the National Association of Broadacsters, and Walt Disney Company.
If you type "senator hollings campaign contributions disney" into
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A>, several other articles come up,
including <A
HREF="http://www.commoncause.org/publications/040297_rpt4.htm">this one</A>.
(Yes, you <EM>can</EM> try this at home.  Type "senator &lt;NAME&gt; campaign
contributions" and see what comes up for your favorite Congresscritter.  Or
"representative &lt;NAME&gt;" for members of the House.)


<P> Here's an article that looks at SSSCA from the manufacturer's 
standpoint:
<A HREF="http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/am-info/Week-of-Mon-20010917/007186.html">
Bill Could Force Copy Control On IT Firms</A>.  It says the SSSCA "could slow
the development of the technologies it seeks to regulate by shifting the
attention of the industry from product development to lobbying."  One attorney
comments, "Telling us what systems to pay for and implement to protect someone
else's property doesn't make sense."

<P>  
<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/21577.html">Another Register
article</A> says the
SSSCA "would close all the irritating little loopholes in the DMCA right
around the necks of consumers, where, the industry reckons, the pressure
rightly belongs."  And, "Conveniently, and by design, the words 'fair use'
appear nowhere in the draft. The industry lobbyists never liked that
troublesome phrase in the DMCA, so now it's gone."  The article also points
out that the SSSCA does not require new complient hardware to be
backward-compatible with older hardware, meaning another round of buying the
same content again.

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">  <!-- ******************************* -->

<P> The <STRONG>role of the 
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</A>
</STRONG> emerged as a topic in activists' discussions.
Many people think of the EFF as a lobbying organization, but its mission is
actually to defend individuals who have been unjustly accused.  Taking on
full-scale lobbying of Congresscritters would require significant changes to
EFF's structure, tarnish its reputation among those who raise their noses at
"lobbyists", place the organization in a different tax category, and distract
it from defending individuals.  

<P> Thus, the free-software and "free Dmitry" groups are debating whether
they should start a lobbying organization themselves.  Of course, one's first
knee-jerk reaction is to stay as far the h*ll away from Washington as
possible, but if we don't do it, who will?  Of course, it would mean doing
some distasteful things.  Like (gasp) making campaign contributions to 
influence a Congresscritter's votes.  Is the free-software community ready to
sponsor a PAC? (PAC = Political-Action Committee, a fancy term for "lobbying
group".)  Even though freeniks have some of the highest noses and loudest
sneers against "lobbying scum"?  Some are considering it, thinking 
it's the only way make a dent in the rapidly-accelerating onslaught against
our rights.  Obviously it's something that it will take a long time to come to
consensus on.

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">  <!-- ******************************* -->

There is another bright side, as pointed out in the IT article.  The media
companies should watch what they wish for because they just might get it.
Perhaps the Law of Unintended Effects will end up applying to them.  Especially
if enough people decide they can do without the Big 5's content.  

<P> Or if artists
start giving away all their music for free.  That would generate more
fans at shows, and bands receive much more money from one concert patron
($5-10, plus $10 if she buys a T-shirt) than they do from one CD purchase
(less than $1).  And if she buys a CD at a show, they both win: she gets a
discounted price (often $10), and the band get a few dollars rather than the 25
cents they would get from a retail sale.

<P> Then we would see corporate profits drop.

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">  <!-- ******************************* -->

In conclusion, the DMCA was passed and nobody noticed.  (A few people like
Richard Stallman <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html">
sounded the alarm</A>, but everybody said it wouldn't get that bad.) Now when
it's too late, we are seeing the effects.  We're also seeing DMCA-like laws
pushed in countries we thought were "safe".  Then the publishers pull a rabbit
out of their hat with another law, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
see that it will also turn out to be more powerful than it appears when it's
passed (if it's passed), just like the DMCA. 

<P> This, coupled with the crypto back door and hacking-considered-terrorism
proposals and others, foreshadow a society fifty years from now vastly
different than now, where everything is pay-per-view, fair use is forgotten,
all available computer hardware enforces this, and Linux has been illegal for
so long that nobody remembers what it was.  But the biggest companies will
still have familiar names--AOL Time Warner, Walt Disney, Microsoft.  The laws
give a competitive advantage to the companies that were dominant at the time of
the laws' adoption, since they can use the laws to sue everybody else out of
existence.  (Why else do you think they pushed so heavily for the laws in the
first place?)  Perhaps many people in today's computer field will drop out in
disgust and switch to other professions, and shun e-mail and the phone in favor
of face-to-face activities.  Farfetched?  Perhaps, but we've learned and not to
trust the CEOs and politicos any farther than we can throw them, and to expect
the worst because it will turn out worse than that.  

<P> Of course, one wonders whether the needs of the publishers for
strong encryption and the needs of the FBI for weak encryption are on a
collision course.  We've already seen that the needs of the FBI (to catch
bad guys) and the needs of e-commerce (to promote a healthy economy) are
opposite: that's why the Clinton administration weakened crypto export laws,
and why the FBI is now pushing back.

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">  <!-- ********************** -->

<STRONG>Other items of interest</STRONG>

<P> <A HREF="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/293/5537/2028">"Anticircumvention Rules: Threat to Science"</A> (Science magazine)
argues that the DMCA is a threat to all scientists, not just those in
computer security and encryption research.  "Virtually all computer
scientists, as well as many other scientists with some programming skills, find
it necessary on occasion to reverse engineer computer programs.  Sometimes they
have to bypass an authentication procedure or some other technical measure in
order to find out how the program works, how to fix it, or how to adapt it in
some way. The act of bypassing the authentication procedure or other technical
measure, as well as the making of a tool to aid the reverse engineering
process, may violate the DMCA.  Although the DMCA also has an exception for
reverse engineering of a program, it too is narrow. It only applies if the sole
purpose of the reverse engineering is to achieve program-to-program
interoperability and if reverse engineering is necessary to do so. Trying to
fix a bug or understand the underlying algorithm does not qualify. Information
even incidentally learned in the course of a privileged reverse engineering
process cannot be divulged to any other person except for the sole purposes of
enabling program-to-program interoperability."  The article also speculates
about a pharmaceutical company that "produces data to prove that a new drug is
safe but technically protects it so that only certain tests can be performed on
the data, all of which support the safety claim. A scientist who doubted the
safety claim and tried to process the data by additional tests would violate
the DMCA if he or she bypassed the access control system restricting use of the
data."

<P> Lawrence Lessig, who wrote _Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace_, is
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/2001/features/LawrenceLessig.php3">interviewed</A>

etc.

that describes some of the lesser-known provisions of the DMCA.

<P> Phil Zimmerman, creator of PGP encryption, 
<A HREF="http://www.philzimmermann.com/news-Response_WashPost.shtml">explains</A>
how he was misrepresented by the Washington Post.  The Post reported that he
was "overwhelmed with feelings of guilt" over the fact that the September 11th
terrorists may have used PGP in planning their attack.  Zimmerman reiterates
that he thinks the public having access to strong encryption without back doors
is a good idea, and that PGP is a good tool for human rights around the world.
He also insists he will not allow any back doors in PGP.
