    Please have a "How-To" for the beginner to set up an ISP for the

<P> hi

<P> i have tried searchin your site for 'share', 'sharing filesystem' etc., but nothin
came up. basically, i've got 6 networked machines, half of which can't take
a full installation of suse 6.3. what i want to do is export the installation on
a 20.4gb disk to the other machines. so say, most of /etc can be shared by
the other machines.

<P> the thing is how can linux be installed on the other machines without doin
a seperate install that takes up all disk space on the local machines. has
anybody tackled this and wrote about it? the thing that appeals to me is
the prospect of simply loggin onto any machine and access my usual apps
and data etc.

<P> Hi 

<P> I am having trouble installing Swing1.0.3/1.1.1 on my RH6.0 system. I
have managed to setup jdk117_v3 successfully sometime ago. 

<P> I have unzipped the tar.Z and placed it in

to my CLASSPATH. I have also added it to a SWING_HOME variable as well
as added a JAVA_HOME variable.

<P> However, everytime I try and compile a java program which tries to
import a swing package, I get the following error :

<PRE>
SwingUI.java:4: Package javax.swing not found in import.

<BR>Subject: More than one keyboard with different layout

<P> Sorry I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, please tell me the
right place if I'm wrong.

<P> I have 2 keyboards connected to my PC, one is a old AT-serial keyboard
and the other an USB-keyboard with Win98 key assignment. Now I'd like to
modify the keymap so I could use the new Command("Windows")-key.
Unfortunalty this conflicts with the old keyboard (which I still need in
case of an emergency). I have to install 2 different keymaps, each one
for each keyboard. but currently the kernel (2.2.14) only allows for one
keyboard.

<P> My wish for enhancement:
Keyboards should be implemented as ordinary devices in the kernel (like
mouses), so an arbitrary count of keyboards where possible. Keymaps,
kbdrates, etc. should be attached to keyboard devices as well.

<BR>Subject: shell scripting in a "C++" based shell

<P> I recently read your article about the basic scripting commands in the April 
issue.  However, the bash system and i are like oil and water, because i am 
more familiar with programing in "C++"  After some searching I was able to 
find some incredibly informative manuals that also contained cdrom packages 
with libraries, patches and other assorted tools to help learn how to script 
some of the varieties of "C" based shell.  Soon enough, my happiness was 
brought to a skreaching halt when i glanced down at some of the prices.  So I 
was writing to ask if maybe in your next issue, you could follow up the 
scripting article with some basic commands in "ksh" or  "zsh," or just inform 
me of any manuals published within a reasonable price range.  
Thanks


<H2>The author Ben Okopnic  &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fuzzybear@pocketmail.com">fuzzybear@pocketmail.com</A>&gt; writes:</H2>

<P> My current goal in writing the column is to concentrate on "bash" until I feel that my readers, by following the column, have reached a high enough level of proficiency that they would be interested in other options - and those may include a look at other shells. Unfortunately for your requirements, this isn't likely to happen for quite a long while. Do be aware, though, that unless you get into somewhat deep scripting stuff (co-processes, async pipelines, etc.), there isn't _that_ much difference between, say, "ksh" and "bash": "ksh" is actually a superset of "sh" which is bash-compatible, and "bash" incorporates a number of "ksh" and "csh" features.

<P> Since I don't know what your level of general scripting/shell expertise may be, let me toss in a perspective from my own experience: the first shell that I ever used was "sh", and it was nothing short of a battle to produce my first script, simple as it was. Later, in my rather brief flirtations with other shells, I found that learning their specific syntax was an *incremental* task - I had already learned 90+% of what I needed to write scripts for them via my experience with "sh". You too may find that it isn't only "bash" that is problematic: there is a learning curve associated with any shell - they all have their quirks. I'm certainly not trying to talk you into switching your shell preference, but you should realize that there's a "cost" associated with entering the "shell game" - and the type of shell is, in my opinion, largely irrelevant to that "cost".

<P> Given the nature of Linux, you'll find that the information that is freely available is copious and of high quality. This implies that any commercially available material will be a) _outstanding_ in quality (this is certainly true in my experience), and b) relatively expensive, since "quality costs". My suggestion for you is to study the free material, look for info on the Net (e.g., "ksh keybindings (vi keys)" in The Answer Guy's column, issue 51 of LG, has some good pointers), and study other people's "zsh"/"ksh" scripts (hint: use AltaVista's Advanced search to look for "#!*/bin/[kz]sh".)

<P> By the time you exhaust those resources, you should either feel justified in your purchase of those "expensive" books - or you may decide that you've lerned enough that you don't need them after all.

this available?

<BR>Subject: Downloading X11/ XF86 upgrades

<P> I am new to the alternative OS world of Linux. I recently purchased a (old)
beginners version of Caldera Linux 1.3 and, through much frustration on my part
as well as the tech reps at Mandrake, have come to realize that my computer's
on- board video card is too modern for the XF86Setup v. 3.3.2. I discovered (I
think) that XF86Setup v. 3.3.6 is the updated one which supports my card (a
Trident Blade 3D/ MVP4). I went to the XF86 web site to download the proper
files and uncovered a plethora of files and folders that have left me rather
confused as to which ones to use. Can anybody tell me which ones (specifically)
from that site to download or, direct me to another mirror site with a bit less
confusing archives and easier to follow guidelines for acquiring these most
needed programs? P.S. I have looked through "rpmfind.net" and could only find
version 4.0 of XF86 for Trident Blade cards. The tech rep at Mandrake said 4.0
would probably not help me. Any further assistance would be greatly
appreciated. Thanks, David P.

<BR>Subject: Please Help

<P> Please help me. I am at my wits end.

<P> I have VERY recently installed Linux, so I am very new to all of this, and
pehaps I am going about this the wrong way. I want to install Oracle8i on my
system. ALL the information says I have to install a JRE (JRE 1.1.6v5) in order
to get Oracle to work. (NOT JDK...JRE).

<P> I CAN NOT find it for the life of me!!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not send
me to Blackdown.org. They do not have it either. Do not send me to Sun, because
they do not have it either. Nor does Susie, nor does Red Hat...NOBODY!! I can
NOT find it. What is up with this??? Is this usual? Why would a company sell me
an operating system (I know, it's free), and the SAME company (Mandrake) sell
me the Oracle81 program, and NOT include it in their package??? (They don't
have JRE 1.1.6v5 either)!

<P> Where can I find it???? I am becoming very discouraged with all the support
I have heard about concerning Linux...(there doesn't seem to be ANY).

<P> hi,
someone can help me!
I have a lab with several PCs, pentium II, running

Clearly :
 I have machine 1 with proxy package, this machine is
connected to internet via modem, the machines 2 
and 3 are connected in LAN and can access to internet
via machine 1.
My probleme is: when I want to get file from  one
machine in another, via ftp, the system refuse with
non

not in the other.
I have the same probleme with telnet.
I have login and passwd in all the machines and i can

<BR>Subject: GUI

<P> Hello,
I am kind of a beginner in the linux world and I have little knowledge about
unix and even less about linux.
I have installed the Linux Redhat 6.1 recently, and that went quite smooth,
it is on an intel machine with now
a lilo boot and a win2000 boot menu, in which I can choose 98 or 2000.
Here comes my problem: when booting the linux i end up in the bourne-shell
login screen, but this is not quite what
I had in mind for interface... 
i had performed the gnome workstation installation, so it should end up in a
x-windows environment if I am correct.
When i did an upgrade installation, it became clear that there were no
interface ( or similar) packages installed, so
I selected the lot of them and installed it. But after rebooting the
bourne-shell was back, and I am at a loss.
It probably is a stupid problem with a simple solution (I hope), but I fancy
some help.

<BR>Subject: A Problem

<P> Dear Editor,

<P> My name is Saqib Shaikh and I live in the UK. I have been reading 
Linux books for a few years now, and decided to put my knowledge 
into practice. I got out my CD of Slackware 3.6, and my old 
computer. My computer's specifications are: 486, 33 mhz 
processor, 4 MB RAM, 80 MB hard drive. The Slackware guide 
said that 4 MB was enough RAM, so gave it a go. I made the boot 
and root floppies. I inserted the boot floppy, powered up, inserted 
the root floppy when asked. It stood there, blank screen, doing 
nothing. I thought on such an old computer it must just be taking 
its time. 25 minutes later I pressed ctrl+alt+del. This has resulted 
in my computer, whenever turned on, giving the error "Cannot find 
ROM basic"!. It does not even check the floppy disk. One last thing 
to mention is that before starting the install I used fdisk to remove 
all partitions, and used fdisk /mbr to remove the mbr. I would be 
extremely greatful for your help. I do not mind throwing the 
computer away, but rather would like to learn the cause for the 
future.

<P> REgards, Saqib Shaikh

<BR>Subject: Newbie installation tips and reorganizing the tech support columns

<BLOCKQUOTE> <EM><H4>[These are excerpts from a long conversation.  My 
proposal is near the end.  Readers: please send in your suggestions or offers
to help! -Ed.]</H4></EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> How about setting up a regular section where people email their problems 
with setting up Linux, especially on a machine that already runs windows 
(along with the solutions of course). I'm suggesting this because of the 
problems that I found when installing Linux - I believe that this is a major 
factor in stopping people from using the operatins system. It wouldn't be 
immediate, but I would be happy to put it all together if you would just 
mention it in the next issue.


<H2>Your humble Editor wrote:</H2>
<P> How would this be different from the Mailbag/2-cent Tips and The Answer Guy?
Do you wish the installation questions moved all together under their own
heading?  Or what is it you're looking for?

<H2>Michael responded:</H2>
<P> Okay....

<P> 1. It is different from the answer guy/2 cent tips as it allows the readers 
to offer their solutions for problems. As good as he is, the answer guy 
cannot answer every problem that may arrise simply because of the range of 
hardware available. If enough people responded, it would end up as a pretty 
comprehensive list of problems that may arrise during the Linux 
installation.  I see your point, it is fairly 
similair to two cent tips. However, it would be purely based around 
installation issues.

<P> 2. Yes, I believe that the installation issues should be moved under a
seperate heading. This is by far the most difficult/traumatic part of Linux (in
my view), especially when there's another OS involved (ie windows). This put me
off installing Linux for almost two whole years.  Those were two wasted years -
there should definately be a comprehensive and detailed guide to installing
Linux (yes, I know they do exist, but I haven't seen any that allow user
contribution on this scale). 




<H2>Your magnificent Editor wrote:</H2>

<P> You are very right about people putting off installing Linux because of
potential installation problems, and how this is "wasted time" when they could
be learning the OS.  Unfortunately, even the most comprehensive book will not
cover all situations.

<P> I'm cc'ing Jim Dennis and Heather Stern (the Answer Guy and HTML Gal)
and Margie Richardson (the Ruler of the Gazette) to get their input
on this.

<P> A good portion of our questions are indeed first-time user issues, and
another good portion deals with adding hardware.  I'm unsure whether
trying to separate those questions out would be worthwhile.  The thing is, the
technical details regarding first-time installation also come back when you add
new hardware, install Linux on `a different computer, etc.

<P> Would you be interested in coordinating the installation- and hardware-
related questions in the Mailbag and 2-Cent Tips?

<P> You could also build something like a knowledge-base index based on
subject with links to the letters, if you're ambitious.  This would be
something to help newbies find the information they need.

<P> The LG FAQ also has a section for questions that come up so frequently
(like Winmodems) that Jim, Heather and I get tired of repeating them,
so we just point people to the FAQ.  If you'd like to augment that
section of the FAQ, it might help some readers.  (Now if readers would only
realize the FAQ exists.  It seems that links on every page and even a link in
the blurb about how to submit a question doesn't help....)

<H2>Heather Stern chimed in:</H2>

<P> Also with many querents it's not clear if they'd fall into the space of
"first tine user" - they didn't say, so we'd be presuming to say so.  And
a very experienced person is often new to the one aspect they're asking about.

<P> The readers already are supposed to be putting forward their own problems
and solutions with 2cent Tips;  but we're getting an increase of people
sending raw Tips to The Answer Guy, usually inspired by a previous letter
in his column.

<P> My personal inclination would lean toward, if Michael's willing to
coordinate it, sprouting Tips (short answers only), Answer Guy, and the
Clueful Hoard (i.e. answerguy like answers from the readership, to
technical questions to the Mailbag) into its own meta-section, with the
FAQ and/or sorted best answers prominently bulleted below these.  For such
an endeavor I'd be happy to throw together some extra graphics, and send
him the current edition of the AnswerGuy preprocessing script, with some
docs on how to use it effectively :)

<P> This would mean some things that presently get pubbed as Tips, and some
messages that come to The Answer Guy, would be moved to the Clueful Hoard.

<P> Jim had originally (way back in the teen issues) figured the Answer Guy
would someday become an Answer Gang.  This is one way to do it.  Another
way to do it would be to turn Answer Guy into a moderated list where the
querent gets a consensus or best answer from the Gang.  I have on occasion
piped in an editorial comment as well...

<P> It's hard to tell who uses Past Answers since if they got their answer,
they generally don't email us...

<P> I made an attempt at sorting Past Answers into topics and Michael, you're
welcome to look at them, even, to become their maintainer (I'm usually a
month or two behind on them), and for the FAQ too.  Deciding on where to
split the topics can be difficult, even if you're willing to link a question
multiple times.  It's behind (3 months I think ;P) but -All- the answers the
Answer Guy wrote up to the last maintenance visit I made to them, are in the
Past Answers.


<H2>Your all-around good guy Mr Editor wrote:</H2>

<P> I'm hearing lots of good suggestions.  Let's think about it for a month
before deciding what to do.  We have two requests: (1) giving Linux newbies
better access to information about configuring their hardware, and (2) a
general reorganizing of the tech support columns.

<P> It's clear that the Answer Guy column is better organized than the
Mailbag/2-Cent Tips in regard to finding the messages that deal with your
question, so I'd like to consider moving all the tech support questions to
that framework.  The Mailbag would then be just for general mail (which usually
means mail about the <EM>Gazette</EM>), and 2-Cent Tips would be for standalone
tips: nifty shell scripts, cool .bashrc settings, etc.  (I really enjoy doing
the standalone tips, so nobody's taking that part away from me. :)

Just another article type, really.

2. A newbie version of the answer guy (all newbie questions would go here)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The Answer Guy is popular because he is (1) an ordinary person answering
ordinary people and (2) he will chase down a lot of weird answers (his 
experience can lead him to give much better than a newbie knows to ask for).

<P> I think it is harmful rather than helpful to suggest that newbies should
somehow get shoved into a corner (what, they're not "allowed" to speak to
the answer guy?  the same one who actually -answers- when he gently flames
the poor weener who is not quite on-topic, or has asked in a creatively
misunderstanding way? I don't think so)  And lest you suggest that I have no 
experience with them... I teach on Mondays, to a few people who are newbies
to Linux and computers themselves at the same time.  If you'd be assuming 
that they even know what an A: is... you'd do them a terrible disservice.

<P> I have no objections to a transformation into a Answer Gang (multiple gurus
in the column, maybe more bubble types?) or a Clueful Hoard (someone edits 
answers from the multitude into a similar column, while the wizardly Answer
Guy answers his as well) but I have a *serious* objection to completely 
restructuring the whole webzine.
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Reader's Tips (this is basically my original idea, concentrating mainly 
on installation and compatibility issues. It too would have an archive 
section split up into easily findable topics)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Tips already exists as a column.  If you're interested in becoming a 
maintainer for it that would probably be great.
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
4. Programming for Newbies (programming is an -extremely- important part of 
Linux. It would not concentrate on more complex and specific issues. It 
would deal with more general and introductory topics and contain links to 
reference material.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<P> This could easily become a longterm column of its own, the transformation
of one unfamiliar with programming into a script wizard and junior programmer.
Good idea.  

<BLOCKQUOTE>
5. Feature artical (each month it would contain a different feature e.g 
setting up Linux under windows etc....)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> You're welcome to contribute ordinary articles to the Gazette during any
month whatsoever, and if you can encourage others to do so also, more power
to you.
 
<P> Didn't we used to have a "weekend mechanic" section?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, I would be happy to moderate and design this with a little help. 
It would not be a huge, certainly not the size of the magazine itself. If 
you want to encourage people to use Linux and get the most out of it, a 
section like this would be great. I know it is a lot more than I originally 
suggested, but I for one certainly believe it would be a good idea.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> On the one hand I want to encourage the enthusiasm.  On the other, I'd like
to note, it's a lot of work merely to corrdinate the answerguy letters into
one column.  I think at one point it was about half the work in the whole
magazine, and that I took it over from Marjorie both made TAG look better,
and allowed Marjorie some breathing room to make the Gazette better.  I do
not honestly believe that one person can do all of this that you describe
without ramping up to it.  Though you claim it'd be smaller than the zine,
it sounds bigger than the early issues of it, and Marjorie had her hands
full every month back then too.  

<P> Take over the FAQs and Past Answers and mush them together nicely, or start
writing articles regularly.  Heck, if you can manage to do both of those
every month without going completely bonkers, maybe a "section for newbies" 
will be completely and utterly unnecessary, because they will tend to find 
what they are looking for.

	<LI> All tech support questions/answers -&gt; Answer Gang/Clueful Hoard

<P> Now to elaborate.


<H4>#1 -- TOPIC INDEX</H4>

<P> This would help newbies (and veterans) find the articles/letters
relevant to their problem.  We'd have to decide on categories (e.g.,
Network/PPP, Hardware/Video Cards, XWindows).

<P> The back end for this is partially covered: each article and TAG answer
already has its own URL, and some tips (not in recent issues) have their
own anchor links as well.  Somebody just needs to categorize the items
and create the entry links in the index.  For tips without their own
anchor link (=all the recent issues), we'd just have to link to the
page.

<P> If we can build a framework that allows contributions from home, then
readers can submit, say, a text file containing all the index
entries for issue X (category, link title, URL), and a script can merge
these into the index.  I can categorize the articles for each current
issue, and the Answer Gang can do the same for the tips, and volunteers
can do the back issues gradually one by one.


<H4>#2 -- Answer Gang/Clueful Hoard</H4>

<P> We need to get more people working on this before we all get burned out.

<P> Heather, can you and Jim propose some logistics on how we could
coordinate keeping the Gang together and getting each question to the Hoard and
moderating the answers?  We first need to know what needs to be done, then we
can figure out who will do what.


<H4>#3 -- Moving the tech support letters/tips</H4>

<P> This will have to wait until the Answer Gang is ready to take it on.


<H4>#4 -- More articles/series</H4>

<P> This will take care of itself as potential authors propose things.
We can list in the Mailbag what series are missing and desired.

We have two articles this issue on shell scripting.  If the authors
would like to put their heads together, perhaps they can come up with
some ideas and manpower for a series or two.  Programming of course 
covers several areas: shell, scripting languages (Python, Perl, etc.),
C-like languages, assembly/low-level stuff, and others.  One series
would be able to cover probably only one of those.

Didn't we used to have a "weekend mechanic" section?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

We did, but the author John Fisk is no longer available.  If somebody
wishes to revive it, that would be great.
