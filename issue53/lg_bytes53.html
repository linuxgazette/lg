<P> Debian has recently added another machine to its computing resources. The
system is an UltraSPARC 60 with dual 360Mhz CPU's and 512Megs of RAM. It
was donated by Sun Microsystems <http://www.sun.com/>. To add to the system,
Sun also donated a Netra st A1000 Telecom Class storage array. The array
contains eight 9gig 10k RPM drives, for a total of 72gigs of raw capacity.
The storage unit, configured as a RAID 5 system, will serve as Debian's new
primary internal archive server.  IntraServer <http://www.intraserver.com/>
also assisted in getting this system operational by donating the PCI
Differential UltraWide SCSI Controller that the array is attached to.

<P> The system is currently running Debian's frozen SPARC GNU/Linux
distribution, potato (aka, Debian 2.2), utilizing a 2.2.15-pre11 SMP
kernel. The machine is being hosted at VisiNet <http://www.visi.net/>,
a Winstar owned ISP <http://www.winstar.com/>.

<P> Magic introduced eService, the Company's new Web-based, enterprise-level
customer service management system that allows companies to manage their
service departments as profit centers.  The new product, which marks the debut
of Magic's new customer relationship management (CRM) suite, streamlines
service workflow and provides companies a comprehensive picture of their
service departments in real time.

<P> In addition, Magic eService reduces costs by making it possible for
companies to employ cost-effective "virtual support centers," where service
agents can work from their own homes around the world.  Virtual support centers
also allow the organization to easily provide 24-hour, seven day a week support
through "follow-the-sun" service that utilizes the availability of the
Internet.

<P> Magic has also signed a deal to deliver  MiTAC Europe Ltd.  Powered by
Magic's eMerchant, the web site will provide consumers easy access to a wide
range of mall-type stores through a three-dimensional interface that helps
simulate a true store-to-store mall shopping experience for the visitor.  It is
a site that MiTAC expects will revolutionize the design and convenience of
online shopping sites.  eMerchant is available for Linux.

<FONT COLOR="green">PileofPcs.Org: open-source Beowulf project
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> (STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN) (April 17, 2000) In an effort to address some of the
barriers that are limiting the spread of Beowulf class cluster-based
supercomputer, 
<A HREF="http://www.Pileofpcs.Org">Pileofpcs.Org</A> has been created. It is
dedicated to the proliferation of cluster-based supercomputing (i.e. Beowulf
class computers) by creating, promoting and sponsoring the Open Source
development of distributions, applications and tools comparable to those sold
by traditional supercomputer vendors. All three of our initial projects are
being hosted at Sourceforge.net.
 
<P> "PileofPcs.Org hopes to hasten the day that clusters of cheap computers
become more useful. Our intention is to apply all the technology,
resources and volunteers we can to help the growth of cluster-based high
performance computing as fast as it possibly can. Furthermore, the
PileofPcs.Org is imbedded and wedded to the Open-Source Philosophy and
community," Dr. Terrence E. Brown, Founder/Executive Director. 
 
<P> We are doing this in a number of ways. First, we are creating a new Linux
distribution (and tools) that will allow anyone to easily create a general
purpose supercomputer - a Vanilla Beowulf without being a linux programming
expert. Second, given that a supercomputer is worthless unless it does
something; therefore, perhaps more importantly, we are also, sponsoring the
development of wide range of useful applications both parallel and
parametric. Additionally, one of the biggest problem with deploying
scalable production-class superclusters is the lack of mature and tested
management tools comparable to what the traditional supercomputer vendors
provide. PilesofPcs.Org aims to change this as well. 
 
<P> Current Projects
1. A new linux distribution that will allow those with limited technical
knowledge create a vanilla Beowulf class supercomputer. SuperClustor Linux
is hosted here. 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4302">http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4302</A>

<P> 2. An Open source version of an base application that would delivers the
high level of performance required for parametric executions by
distributing the jobs over a computer cluster and/or network. This
application will allow users of cluster systems to using already existing
programs with little of no rewriting. Commercial products that do similar
tasks include Clustor and EnFuzion. This would be an open source
alternative to them. OpenClustor is hosted here.
http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_idC03

<P> 3. An open source version of a base application that would enable users
with no particular knowledge in Linux, to setup, configure and manage a
linux cluster. With ease of use so that simple click is enough to add or
remove nodes, monitor processors loads and temperatures. Users will no
longer be required to anymore to allocate specific resources to build and
maintain their cluster supercomputer. A commercial product of this nature
include Alinka's Raisin. SuperCluster Manager is hosted here.
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4304">http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4304</A>

<P> PileofPcs.Org is looking to support and encourage the development many
other application and/or tool projects including two special types: those
requiring parallelization and those supporting parametric execution. We
want to spur the development applications for all types of situations
including, but not limited to science, finance, multimedia, bioinformatics,
statistics, weather, data mining, design, neural networks, modelling, etc.

<P> 1. Parallelized applications - Although efficient parallelization is a
property of the specific beowulf computer, we believe that we can promote
the creation of pre-parallelized applications. While this will be a
challenge, creating a repository for pre-parallelized and parallelized code
with help speed the development of useable applications for all. 

<P> 2. Applications that support parametric execution - Parametric executions
require that the same application is executed numerous times. A single
application is run under a wide range of input conditions and the results
of these different runs are collected together. Parametric executions are
ideally suited to run on large computing clusters, since they produce a lot
of jobs, often exceeding thousands. These applications will allow users to
tap power of distributed computing.

<P> PileofPcs.Org is looking for Project leaders, developers, html designers,
and all others interested in the PileofPcs.Org and Open Source movement.
PileofPcs.Org is also looking for software and hardware sponsors to
facilitate the rapid development and deployment of our efforts.

in a service-level agreement (SLA). 

<P> He commented that, "Our customers have certainly appreciated the increased
reliability of our hosting service as network availability has increased to
99.982% over the past year, and 100.000% over the last 90 days."

<P> There are multiple grades of high-availability hosting-they are named
according to the number of "nines" in the uptime percentage. 90% is one nine or
Class I, 99% is two nines or Class II, 99.9% is three nines or Class III, and
so on. Class V is 99.999% and means that the site is down only 5 minutes per
year as opposed to a Class 1 which means that your site is down for 876 hours
per year (or 73 hours per month). Most hosting providers are currently
providing Class I or lower hosting. Few offer the guarantee of an SLA.

<P> Class 1 hosting is most appropriate for companies interested in maintaining
an Internet presence that is informative in nature. Class II hosting is
recommended for companies who are outsourcing their e-mail system or doing
P.O.S. retailing over the Internet. Class IV hosting is required by companies
involved in Manufacturing, Utilities, Telecommunications Customer Service, or
whose business is strictly eCommerce. Class V hosting is business critical to
health systems, satellite navigation, reservation systems, banking (EFT and ATM
transactions) and financial securities trading. Class VI (99.9999%) hosting is
used by defense systems in launch readiness.

<FONT COLOR="green">OpenAL: a 3D audio library
</FONT>
</H3> 


<P> San Jose, CA. -- March 8, 2000 -- Loki Entertainment Software, the 
leading publisher of commercial games for the Linux operating system, 
announced a multi-company project to create and distribute OpenAL, 
an open-source, cross-platform 3D-Audio library.

<P> 3D-Audio greatly improves the immersive quality of a game. It allows 
games and other applications to take advantage of powerful spacialized 
sound effects, including distance and direction attenuation, panning and 
reverb. With these features, gamers can, for example, determine by sound 
the distance and direction of an explosion in a 3D-gaming environment.

<P> "OpenAL represents a milestone for Linux and for the game industry in 
general," said Scott Draeker, president, Loki Entertainment Software. 
"Until now, games running on Linux have not had access to the advanced 
3D-Audio features available on other platforms. OpenAL provides those 
advanced features with an open-source, nonproprietary implementation 
which is available not just for Linux, but for Windows and MacOS games as 
well. What SGI's OpenGL has done for 3D-Video, OpenAL will do for 
3D-Audio."

<P> Creative Technology, 
plans to release Linux drivers that will work with OpenAL, and which 
natively support the advanced 3D-Audio effects which OpenAL enables. In 
addition, Creative is evaluating MacOS and Windows implementations of the 
OpenAL standard

<P> Loki is already incorporating OpenAL into its growing product line of 
AAA Linux games. In March, Loki will release the Linux version of 
Activision's Heavy Gear II, the first Linux game to support 3D-Audio 
using OpenAL.

<P> The source code for OpenAL for Mac, Windows and Linux is freely available 
for download and is offered under the GNU Library Public License (LGPL).
