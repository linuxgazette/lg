Hi Folks
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Ben recently said (in the powerpoint thread) that he uses mgp and since I
wanted to fiddle with it a little too I thought I ask here:
Is it possible to <EM>embed</EM> the mplayer window in mgp? Has anyone done this? I
managed to get mplayer to play with the %system call but I had to disable
mgp to take over the screen (thus become windowed) and mplayer will run in
its own window too.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Not that I'm an expert on "mgp", but I believe that's the only way you
can have it: "mplayer" does not take a "-geometry" option, and that's
what the "%xsystem" tag (which embeds an X app) requires. For an example
of this, take a look at "sample.mgp" in your "docs/mgp/examples"
directory.
 -- Ben</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
If no one has, mplayer might get embedded when I know the
win id of mgp via -wid id. xwininfo spits it out but I wanted to do
something like this.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
in bla.mgp:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>&gt; %system "mplayer vid.mpg -vo x11 -wid `some bash script or command to get the win id`
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
But for xwininfo I have to click into the window or provide it with the win
id

Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
We just had a "Linux" technician come out to our office and install RedHat as
our Internet Proxy and Mail Server and he has now left...however, I am left
holding the bag to figure it all out and how to fix various things.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
One item is the figure out how to make the Net2phone program work..  Except
for the Linux Server, everyone uses Windows.  Since we are in Africa, this
program is very important for the staff to call home.  I have no idea what to
put in the TCP or UDP port sections.  Is there a standard port or do I have
to configure something on the Linux server (a machine totally dedicated to
Linux) or what?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Also, with our previous Mdaemon email service where we used Windows 2000, we
were able to keep a copy of all emails going in/out in an archive area so
that we could refer back to them should someone lose their mail or couldn't
find an email sent to them/from them.  I don't know how to configure the
RedHat to place outgoing/incoming mails onto another computer as an archive.
Can you help with this as well?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I assume the tech installed sendmail as your mail server.  While it is a
very good mail server, it doesn't do copies as you'd like.  (Things
might have changed in the years since I tried it, but I'm too tired to
investigate it right now.)  If you uninstall sendmail and install
postfix, it can easily be done.  Postfix has a configuration option
called "always_bcc" which will copy all incoming and outgoing email to
another account. However, without knowing the setup you have (did the
tech set up aliases?  Any special options like masquerading?), it might
not be as simple as un/installing some RPMs.  -- Faber
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm here in West Africa where I have little or no help and no reference
books.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Since you say "the Internet works", you've got a plethora of reference
materials!  All you need actually. Check out The Linux Documentation
Project at <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org"
	>http://www.tldp.org</A>.  There are HOWTOs on setting up
mailservers and much more.
</P>
<P>
Another great resource is Google (www.google.com). Searching for
"Net2phone linux" at google brought up several links that might help
you.  -- Faber
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Only a little common sense and alot of prayer.  I would appreciate
ANY help anyone could give me concerning these two items.  I may have been
vague with my requests but since I'm new at this, I'm not very clear about
anything other than the Internet works and the mail does go out and come in.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
THANKS A MILLION FOR ANY RESPONSE

Hya folks!
</P>
<P>
I am struggling to install Japanese support on my Linux box based on Mandrake
8.1 (western Europe edition). Despite following instructions on how to do
this I am quite at a loss what's going on. (Is that another point I have in
common with 90% of all Linuxians using/understanding 10% of Linux' capacity?)
</P>
<P>
Reminder: I'd like to have the facility to enter and read Japanese text in a
wordprocessor and email programme and to look up a dictionary, but run a
Linux box based on a western European interface and latin1/latin15 input.
JWPce (a Freeware for Windows and, DO believe it, stable) would be an
excellent comparsion.
</P>
<P>
So far, I have used two different methods:
</P>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>
I added Japanese language support and programmes to my -then- quite well
running linux box, undertook necessary changes in following instructions
found at quite a few places too many to remember, and experimenting myself
with different configurations and setups. Now, using a user account to work
with the linux box I start up the x-display (KDE) : in a quite random fashion
the icons and panel show up and I can get on working, or it may show only the
icons on the desktop and no panel at all, or, at the worst, just show a blank
screen. Only several "logouts" or even "reboots" may grant me with an
eventual display of a correctly fonctionning environment. This problem does
not all turn up when I log in as root. I de-installed all programmes and
replaced changed config files with the original ones I saved as backups.
However, even having carefully "cleaned" up the problem persisted. Having
been (and I still am) at a loss I decided to


<LI>
I reinstalled the whole system with Japanese language support and programmes
which -at the beginning- worked out fine ... just fine for two sessions when
the X-Display seemed to have changed its mind. Now, despite much praying on
my knees, it may start up correctly and show the working environment, or it
may show icons on the desktop only but no panel at all, or it may just show a
blank screen. Here, too, root encounters no problem whatsoever.
</ol></blockQuote>
<P>
The actual problem is not the permission to use this or that programme,
but that the x-Display only displays when it is (and I take it for being just
that) in the mood to do so.
</P>
<P>
Strangley, the Japanese fonts I installed show up in a browser, Emacs or wih
a fontviewer, but so far I have not yet had the opportunity on how to using
them in applications like Kmail or a wordprocessor.
</P>
<P>
For now, I re-installed the whole system without Japanese support and
programmes, and all runs as smoothly as before.
</P>
<P>
I would greatly appreciate it if you and/or a reader could help me out here.
I wonder if the problem is due to programmes which supply Japanese support
(FreeWnn, Kinput2 and the likes) and upset the X-display or if I am missing
out something very badly but am too blind to see... Would you know if
Japanese have the same problem the other way round? If they install the
Japanese version of a Linux Distribution and install let's say European
language support and programmes, does the x-display play up, too?
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">. . . a day passes . . .
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
Hya folks!
</P>
<P>
Refering to my recent email concerning the installation of Japanese language
support and programmes, I hasten to inform you that I solved the mistery (or
missery?) after some clicks only. Why make it easy when it you can make it
yourself difficult...
</P>
<P>
In fact, when installing a distribution (reminder: I use Mandrake 8.1,
western Europe edition) you need to select your language, the Japanese
language and some programmes needed to enter Japanese text in a
wordprocessor, email programme etc. Once the distribution installed, ROOT
needs to execute "<TT>/usr/sbin/localedrake</TT>" and choose Japanese instead of the
original language.
</P>
<P>
A user can configure his environment in two different ways:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Grand A
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
Personal Country, Language and Keymap are set of the user's choice. This
does not alter the the display of the interface or menus : they continue to
be displayed in the corresponding language.
To enter Japanese text in say Kword, hit the keys SHIFT and SPACE and then
enter the text in r-o-m-a-j-i. Nevertheless, how to get out of this mode I
would not know... One more thingy : having set the iso8859-15 keymap, the
user will not be able to type in the EURO currency symbol - although the
personal configuration panel for Country and Language show that symbol. Luck¥
Japane$e, Bri£ish and American$!!! Another thingy : mc displays illegible
caracters when it comes to OK, CANCEL or displaying names of directories.
Other thingies remain to be discovered yet.
Hint : only ROOT can help here. ROOT needs to reset the language to the
original language via "<TT>/usr/sbin/localdrake</TT>" and Europeans can join the
"international-currency-display-users'-club", meaning all's back to normal,
meaning as normal as normal can normally be.
</P>
<P>
Grand B.
</P>
<P>
To display a Japanese interface and menus the user needs to select his
country (not Japan - unless you have a Japanese keyboard or you do not mind
searching for the right keys and combination, that is). As to language and
keymap the user needs to select Japanese in the first case, and a keymap
compatible with Japanese input (say keymap "jisx0208.1983-0" or "iso10646-1")
in the latter case. Sure, the user may as well go for a real Japanese
distribution, but you KNOW what they are saying:  "Do it at your own risk!"
Personally, I don't, and, mind you, I don't even know where to click when it
reads "Quit" on a Japanese screen.
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to note the different effects this has on <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> and <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>.
</P>
<P>
I have come across suggestions like adding someTHINGs to SOME files like
"XMODIFIERS="@im=kinput2" LANGUAGE=xx_yy LC_TYPE=ja_JP" (where xx_yy stands
for the abbreviation of your country) or something like "LANG=ja8JP.eucJP" or
"LANG_ja.JP.UTF-8" ... but hey! Hey, wait a minute! I am just a simple minded
user (Yours respectfully, of course) and not a fullblown Linux administrator
with years of experience. But then again, I could become one as <A HREF="mailto:LinuxG@zette"
	>LinuxG@zette</A>
has helped me in the past. So, I remember a Perl script "Uncle Ben" sent me
to rename quite a view files... but I'm straying and Ben might have some
trouble steering off the course of an oil tanker.
</P>
<P>
Now that I have overcome this -how shall I put it-  "Japanese problem", I am
interested in learning how to install, configure, handle and use Indian
input. Any readers up here willing to help me, please?
</P>
<P>
It is my hope that some readers could find some assistance.
</P>
<P>
Thanking you in advance (not only in case you put in a higher gear to get me
some help), I remain

<P>
I have a RH based system with gcc3.2 glibc-2.2.92
</P>
<P>
I want to compile some programs (old gnome2 etc) against glibc-2.2.5 -
is this feasible?
</P>
<P>
The basic reason is to distribute RH7.3 rpms (ATM mozilla and galeon)

In a previous issue someone mentioned they were running AutoCAD on
Linux.  That is, they were running it most happily inside VMware, if I recall
correctly:

We currently have a dozen engineers running Autocad on Windows (various

Autocad had a Linux version.  I don't mean to be a total newbie here but
what version of Autocad are you running and have you ever tried LinuxCAD
which claims to be 100% Autocad compatible.

...and I innocently thought to myself, "Gee, okay, that sounds neat,
I'll mention it."  Both these authors are obviously experienced engineers.
I went looking for myself, to see what else I could find, to mention next
to it.

<P>
But I didn't find it in <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A> (though there are 53 listings in their
electronic design subcategory alone).  The product's commercial
(<A HREF="http://www.linuxcad.com"
	>http://www.linuxcad.com</A>).  As is AutoCAD, of course.  There are drawing
ryam3d.orgograms mentioning CAD as one among many 2-D uses they can offer. (Is
it still CAD if you are only drafting in two dimensions? well, it's a
computer, and you're designing, so I guess so.)  I found one that
designs LEGO layouts

<P>
The question then comes up, what do you want to use CAD <EM>for</EM> ...
</P>
<P>
I asked my friend 'Dillo, an experienced 3-D artist (among other things),
what he uses.  He made special note to warn me that the difference between
modelling software and CAD is that CAD will enforce real-world measurements.
E.g.  the intaglio on this pot is exactly 0.125 cm deep.  For what he
usually does, he's not sending things to a lathe, and just modelling is fine;
he uses Ayam, a free front end for Renderman:
<A HREF="http://www.ayam3d.org"
	>http://www.ayam3d.org</A>
</P>
<P>
I have big dreams of replicating little starship cutaway views, re-plotting
my garden or living room layout, abusing my SMP motherboard with lighting
calculations, stuff like that.  "Dreaming" is the key word here.  I found
myself in the deep side of the CAD swimming pool with no water wings, and
drowning -- things are pretty polarized, either no documentation or it
assumes that you're already experienced as an engineer.  I have a great
sense of geometry, and I'm a good hand with the GIMP, but this just isn't
my field.  So far I'd be safer staying in the GIMP.
</P>
<P>
We need someone with some real examples to measure these things
up against, to bring this all to life with some fun, and give us
something that engineering newbies like me can enjoy and work our way
through too.  Having a bit of a bake-off about the different kinds of CAD
and modelling available would be a plus.

<P>
Gooooood Morning LG!
</P>
<P>
There I have it (thanks Rick!) : what with my eternally installing Linux
instead of putting poorly configurated files and setups right ...
</P>
<P>
Thank you so much for having sent some helpful mails concerning the (hum,
"my" ) x-display's mood and configurating foreign languages support.
</P>
<P>
Mizspelling (yes, MiS) : all that fumbling on the keyboard trying to get
foreign languages support on my linux box has given me some bad habits, I
reckon.
</P>
<P>
Rekoining : as to rekoining (with a C, please) a phrase, in fact, it should
not be known as "nobody's perfect" but "nothing's perfect". So, raising on
one of the back benches I bow me head and admit not having payed much
attention whilst setting up the email prog, particularly the e-address.
</P>
<P>
Felicitation -excuse me/veuillez m'excusez/'tschuligung- congratulation for
your restyled web pages! You may now rightly raise and shine and ask around
"now, who's the best?" unless, well, unless you do even better!
</P>
<P>
Yours linuxely, Wilf

Hi,
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000099"><EM>
Google had me stumble over your request in the Linux Gazette. Since I
have the same problem (have to use sendmail for a specific reason, but
still want to use courier imap), I'm interested in whether you found a
solution yet?
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>

This is the first time I am faced with the task to set up a mailing

sendmail to use procmail as delivery agent, and roughly what to do to
make procmail deliver in the maildir format and, say, into "~/mail"?

<P><STRONG>
Yes, rather annoying to find out that things worked in the first place and I
spent 3 days hunting shadows. Turned out sendmail was already configured to
use procmail in my distro (<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.2 on a remote server), and all that was
basically missing were
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
a. <TT>/etc/procmailrc</TT> with the source and target directories
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
b. courier-imap, though that had me turning in circles again until I found
the pw2userdb and makeuserdb commands in <TT>/usr/lib/courier-imap/share</TT> after
building and starting the daemon.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sheesh. Now I just need to figure out what auth module courier is using and
see how to use PAM if it's not using that yet. I guess I should also try
compile a Step-by-step guide for other Linux mail Newbies like me...
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Excellent!  We'd love to see it.   It'd make a good Article for the
<EM>Gazette</EM> if it's long enough, or an Answer Gang posting if enough of us
are all chattering during the notes.
</P>
<P>
If you're inclined to do it article style, our article guidelines are
pretty simple, see <A HREF="../faq/author.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html</A>.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
the least I can expect is that ppl rip it apart in the air and point out the
millions of errors I made and the myriads of places where I could have done
something better, which means I get to learn more, and gather a few more
e-mails belonging to intelligent and helpful individuals I can contact in
the future when I again have mail problems (e.g. in case I really have to
change my sendmail config, or go deeper into fetchmail or promail
or...whatever).
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Good attitude, I like that.
</P>
<P>
You can always post questions to the Gang at
<A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A>;  if you're inclined to help others too,
and not afraid of dealing with the extra burst of mail, you can join the
mailing list.   Don't worry, we're all good at something and not so
great at other things ... even the really experienced souls among us.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Oh, that reminds me. I want to offer a web interface for users to access my
imap server. That alone should be perfectly doable since there are a couple
imap webmail interfaces out there. But I want them to be able to add pop3
servers to their fetchmail list.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Which suggests that you'll either want a privileged CGI )to let them get
at their fetchmailrc) or some cronjob help (to let them work in
unprivileged CGI space, then have something sanity check and apply the
change to the real fetchmailrc).
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Internally, I want to run a single fetchmail daemon (probably I'll just
create a dedicated fetchmail user (e.g. "getmail") and let the scripts add
the account/user mappings to that user's .fetchmailrc so I don't have one
fetchmail demon running per mail user, which could be a bad idea if there
were 50 users all polling 5 POP3 accounts every minute, I don't really know
about the load though).
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hard to say ...
</P>
<P><STRONG>
My main question is if I can tell fetchmail to not only run as a daemon, but
to configure each and every individual POP account to be polled at their own
intervals, like this:
</STRONG></P>

<code><strong><font color="#000033"><br>&gt; poll account1 for user toby every 5 minutes
<br>&gt; poll account2 for user sam every 60 minutes
<br>&gt; poll account3 for user anne every 10 minutes
</font></strong></code>
<P><STRONG>
I've read about the "set daemon" command in .fetchmailrc, but that only
determines the interval the daemon wakes up at to do its job. A very ugly
solution that I basically discarded before I tried it would be to create one
fetchmail user for every account used, and set a daemon for that. But that
would not only see the server run one daemon per user, but even one daemon
per POP3 account. There must be a nicer way.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Do you know one?

<P>
In issue 83 of the Linux Gazette, you give some possible origins
for the word "daemon":
<A HREF="../issue83/tag/1.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue83/tag/1.html</A>
</P>
<P>
The term "daemon" comes from the demons in Oliver
Selfridge's paper 'Pandemonium', MIT 1958, which was named
after the capital of Hell in  Milton's 'Paradise Lost'.
Selfridge likened neural cells firing in response to
input patterns to the chaos of millions of demons
shrieking in Pandemonium."   He proposed program elements,
called "demons" that would model the activity of the
neural cells and respond whenever a particular pattern
appears in the input.  The term later grew from its use
in Artificial Intelligence to being used in the context
of operating systems.  The concept of "interrupts" was
considered akin to a demon "shrieking" in response to
the input pattern.

<P>
I'd like to kindly request that if you are not going to answer someone,
do not take the extra time nor waste the extra bits to blow them off.
</P>
<P>
We do not promise to give all requesters an answer, and I know that
a lot more off-topic questions are arriving since we re-opened the
floodgates labelled "tag" and "answerguy".
</P>
<P>
We also didn't promise that we're suits, keeping our thoughts squeaky
clean and so on... but I note that there is some line between
advocacy,  curmudgeonly 'tude, and just plain being rude.  I do not
believe we're meeting the prime directive -- Making Linux A Little
More Fun! -- if we make the borg kids run away in tears.  Let 'em meet
silence until they're ready to ask real Linux questions.
</P>
<P>
In other words if y'all sharpen the razor wit too far I'm gonna have
to install a first aid kit in the TAG beer lounge.
</P>
<P>
<EM>However</EM> if you answer in the off-the-cuff spirit of the original
Answer Guy, Jim Dennis (hi hon!) ... by answering a patently
mswin/solaris/weird-OS question with the Linux version of the answer,
then I'll cheerfully make sure that your favorite brewski is present
in the TAG Fridge.  In this way Jim often actually answered them,
while hinting strongly that Linux makes it, whatever "it" is, a bit
less painful.  Pass the pretzels, please.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I'm pleased to say that in addition to some backroom silliness about
coffee, ginger beer, and the exact methods we use to refill the pretzel
jar, we've also been seeing a bit more helpfulness from the Gang in
regards to cross-platform issues.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Issues where Linux is not involved at all are still for somebody else
to deal with, though.  Please mention which variety of Linux you're
having trouble with when writing to us.  Thanks.
