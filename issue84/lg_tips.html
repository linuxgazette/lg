Here's a way to "munge" your email address on your Web page so that
spammer's bots can't grab it:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>perl -we'map{printf"&amp;#%s;",ord}split//,pop' user@host.com
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Use your address, and stick the output into your HTML where you'd
normally use your address. It will display correctly, but all that the
bots will see will be something like
</P>
<P>
&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#64;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;

friend of mine also uses tricks to confuse them as to where the @ sign
has gotten to... SGML comments within their domain name, stuff like
that.  Yet another shows their address and phone number within a PNG
of their business card (although, admittedly, this is not lynx-clean).
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">A combination of such tricks, combined with a couple of
"sentinel" addresses which look legit but are only for spambots to

<BR>Dan Wilder (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=aneta@cox.net&cc=dan@ssc.com&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2084%5D%202c%20Tips%20%233">dan from ssc.com</a>)
<BR>Question by aneta (aneta from cox.net)


<P><STRONG>
where do bad clusters come from?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The Great Bad Cluster Cabbage Patch in the Sky.
</P>
<P>
Seriously, bad clusters represent errors in a file system.  They may be
soft errors, for example where power failed or the OS crashed during a
write to disk.  It could be where there are some bad bits on RAM that
was used to hold data on the way to the filesystem.   It may be that the
computer has problems with its power circuitry, either in the power
supply or in the power distribution circuits, filters, regulators and so
on on the motherboard.  Or the underlying problem may be failed sectors
on the disk.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
also my friend has an HP pavilion with
windows 98, she has 3 bad clusters and her computer is running anciently
slow. i'm running a windows 95 format disk to reformat her computer and
so far it has been running for 3 days just trying to recover the
allocation units, why is it running slow, and will re-formatting take
care of some of the problems since she does have bad clusters?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
In either the Linux case, which is what this mailing list is about, or
other operating systems, it's time to enlist the services of somebody
with serious diagnostic tools and skills.  Simply reformatting the
disk is very unlikely to cure the underlying problem, unless it was
merely due to a power glitch.  It probably wasn't a good idea to begin
the reformat prior to consulting an expert, as you may have erased some
of the information that would lead to a correct diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
Or, it might just be time to replace the computer.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I wouldn't rush to that as the first thing; it may only be the hard disk
that's bad, not the whole machine.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">If a bad controller on the motherboard is doing it, well yes, then it's
probably easier to just replace the box.

I know nearly nothing about drives.  I purchased a cd-rd drive and can't
get it to work.  I have installed the drive, but it won't work.  The
switch on the back of the drive is set in the middle.  There is no
writing on the switches, so I assumed the switch was set on the slave
from the factory.  From what I have read it seems like it has something
to do with my ide.  But I have no idea how to set that.  The drive does
not show up in my hardware properties.  Do you think you can help?

Thanks in advance

If so you should call Microsoft and see if they offer support for

[K.-H.] 
Start earlier -- bo into bios setup and do a "drive detect" if available.
Does it show up there? Also All IDE CD drives I had gave some boot message
during the BIOS search for IDE devices. This is before the box with the
summary comes but after the memory countup.

If it's not there the hardware is not detected and something is quite wrong

Try the HOWTOs...

You'll probably have to rebuild your kernel or load a module

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In general IDE CDR/CDRW drives under Linux are accessed through
the SCSI emulation layer.  Thus you normally have to build the
ide-scsi module (either into your kernel, statically, or as a
loadable ".o" file).  Normally you'd also have to pass the kernel
a command line hint like hdc=ide-scsi which will force the system
to direct all traffic to that IDE device through the SCSI emulation
subsystem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The oddity of this is that it affect normal access to CDs via
that device, too.  Thus to mount a normal CD in that drive you'd use
the <TT>/dev/scd0</TT> (or other <TT>/dev/scd*</TT>) device node.  Writing to CDR and
CDRW media would generally go through the <TT>/dev/sg0</TT> (or similar)
devices -- sg is "generic scsi device" (printers, scanners, etc).
(Actually the cdrecord command uses a three part bus, ID, LUN address
for this).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Iron] 
If it's a new drive, I would return it and say the inadequate labeling is
preventing you from using the drive.  Maybe that will goad the manufacturer
into doing what practically all other manufacturers have done: put labels
with diagrams on the drive.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An IDE drive normally has a jumper (not a switch) with three positions:
"master", "slave" and "cable select".  Some also have a position for "single".
IDE cables have three plugs so they can fit two drives on one controller.  If
this is the only drive on the cable, it must be "single" (if such a position
exists) or "master" (if it doesn't).  If there is another drive on the cable
too, one must be "master" and the other "slave".  "Cable select" was one of
those nifty new ideas that never caught on, so don't bother with it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If an IDE plug fits it, it's probably an IDE drive.  I've never seen one with
a switch instead of jumpers, but it's possible.  Is it an external drive?
Those would be more likely to have switches.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the switch is unlabeled you'll have no choice but to try all three positions
and see which one works.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The IDE cable should be connected with the red stripe facing toward the power
cable.  On the motherboard, the red stripe should go toward the pin marked "1".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The power cable is connected, right?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's possible it's not an IDE drive at all but a SCSI drive.  The plug would
be a different shape and the switch would have numbers (0-8 or 0-16).

Dear Friend,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have a computer with two operating
systems: Win98+Linux. Now I want to delete
the whole Linux system to free its space into Win98.
The selection of boot for a certain operating
system is by LILO at start. Can you tell me
1) How to delete the Linux?
2) After delete Linux, that means delete LILO
too, so can I still boot the computer into Win98?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Many thanks
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Use a win98 startup disk or the win98 cd to boot.  Run fdisk, delete the
linux partitions using the non-dos partition optoins.  Then exit, run
fdisk <TT>/mbr.</TT>  Reboot with the disk or disc, run fdisk again and create a
new dos partition.  Reboot, format the parition.  Why you would want to do
this is beyond me.  You should be deleting the win98 partition to free up
some disk space for the linux partition.
</P>

<BR>Karl-Heinz Herrmann, Pradeep (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=sarath@scientist.com&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2084%5D%202c%20Tips%20%238">the <em>LG</em> Answer Gang</a>)
<BR>Question by Sarath Ananthapadmanabhan (sarath from scientist.com)

<P><STRONG>
hello answerguy,
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hi Sarath,
</P>
<P>
It's gang now, not guy: see <A HREF="../faq/index.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/faq/index.html</A>
or www.linuxgazette.com/authors
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I am a final year software engineering student and I want some
driver writing information. I would like to know how to obtain enough
information about my cd-writer to write a driver for it. This is important
for my final sem project and I can't seem to find anything on the web.Even
a few helpful links would do.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You already asked this on the cdwrite mailing list and you got one answer
pointing you to the SCSI MMC-3 specifications, so why not try to locate it?
The cdwrite mailing list certainly has the more knowledgeable people on this
particular issue. So they do expect you to know at least to some degree what
you are talking about if you venture to write a cd-writer driver from scratch
and they think a pointer like they gave should be sufficient. If you have
particular questions/problems on implementation that will be a good place to
ask again.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I read that u are an LG fan.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I am certainly not an LG fan (neither the cdrom manufacturer nor the Indian(?)
electronics manufacturer (TV's and stuff) if they are not the same.
</P>
<P>
I certainly <EM>am</EM> a fan of Linux Gazette so....
</P>
<P><STRONG>
The device I'm talking about is an LG GCE-8160B (16x max).Hope you can
help me with it.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
So -- that might be an IDE drive or might not be an IDE drive. I guess it is.
</P>
<P>
in any case: The protocol used to access these devices --- and all newer
CD-writers are ATAPI/SCSI MMC-3 compliant --- is the MMC-3 specification.
Actually ATAPI for CDROM drives is nothing but SCSI over IDE, so the devices
understand scsi commands which are sent over the IDE hardware connection. In
Linux (to be a little bit ontopic for a LINUX-questions-only) there is a
ide-scsi driver which is taking care of the scsi over ide commands part, so
you don't have to worry about that when writing the driver. (NT BTW does the
same, burners and  Co are treated as SCSI devices).

<P>
SO:

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>try to get hold of this specifications

   like typing "mmc-3 specification" in www.google.com... but this is not the
   first hit there and will require some digging. It is well possible that you
   have to buy that in printed book form from somewhere.
   I get lots of *.msdn.* hits, maybe you find something generic there too.

   you <EM>are</EM> trying low level hardware programming so getting used to that
   kind of bit poking manuals will be unavoidable I guess


<LI>get cdrecord and/or cdrdao and have a look at <EM>their</EM> code, especially
   the library libscg might be interesting since it's handling all the low
   level data transfers


<LI>be aware that this is a major project, i.e. to write a successful driver
   for at least most of the CD-R's features
</ol></blockQuote>
<P>
If you need info on how to write a device driver for Linux there is a HowTo
out there..... hmm. (some poking about in the web-shelves ensues)
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
What I could find are the SCSI-programming howto's:

Look for SCSI one page down.

<P>
(it doesn't evade view for long, though.)

Tue, 08 Oct 2002 12:22:32 -0400
<BR>Allan Peda (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=&cc=pedaa@rockefeller.edu&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2084%5D%202c%20Tips%20%239">pedaa from rockefeller.edu</a>)
<BR>and an alternive answer to same problem, by Ben Okopnik 

<!-- ::
Cheap duplex fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
seeking to do a better one...
:: -->
<P>
Hi:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
I wanted to share a trivial printing fix, and ask a question.
We recently upgraded here to a duplex printer,  which worked terrific,
except that when duplex printing from my Redhat 7.3 box every second
page was offset an extra centimter to the right.  It didn't matter which
application I used either.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
I tried a few different drivers, but they all had this problem. Rather than
approach this trial and error I decided to intercept the input
Postscript and
fix the margins.  Admittedly this is not finding the  cause of this
problem,
but it works.
</P>
<P>
I edited the <TT>/etc/printacap</TT> file (after backing it up) to point to a
different
magic filter wrapper for the duplex printer, and copied the original
wrapper to a new "improved" one.
</P>
<P>
I called this mf_wrapper_duplex, the diff output from the original
mf_wrapper and mf_wrapper_duplex follows:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>diff  /usr/share/printconf/util/mf_wrapper
/usr/share/printconf/util/mf_wrapper_duplex
45c45
&lt; /usr/bin/magicfilter-t "$TMP_FILE" $DEBUGSTRING &lt; /dev/stdin
---
 &gt; pstops -b 2:0\(0,0\),1\(-1cm,0\) &lt; /dev/stdin |
/usr/bin/magicfilter-t "$TMP_FILE" $DEBUGSTRING
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I use pstops to adjust margins on the postscript data stream, using the
'-b'
option to strip binding information, and push the margins over 1 centimeter
to the left via the 2:0(0,0),1(-1cm,0) rule,  - see the pstops manual.
I then restarted lpd.
</P>
<P>
Of course this is not a perfect, or even a really correct solution, for
one the printconf utility will
overwrite this, so it should be put in <TT>/etc/printconf.local</TT> but I was
getting really
annoyed at the margin drift on the even number pages.  Also, I believe
the data stream into
magicfilter might not be postscript, so it would break on this as well.
</P>
<P>
I think this should really be done in magicfilter - does anyone know how
to hack this nicely?
</P>
<P>
Thanks
<BR>Allan
</P>
<HR width="10%" align="center"><P>
For quite a while now, I've had a printing problem - plain text always
came out shifted about an inch to the left, and some characters "fell
off" the page. Until recently, I didn't bother fixing it - instead, I'd
bring up the text in "vim", issue an ":ha" (hardcopy) command, and
presto!... of course, this required setting up "vim" to print (see my
"Fancy Printing in Vim" tip in LG#79.)
</P>
<P>
However, I <EM>really</EM> dislike it when things don't work the way they
should, and I got around to this recently. Since I use "magicfilter" to
process all of my print stuff, I simply edited
"<TT>/etc/magicfilter/StylusColor-II@720dpi-filter</TT>" (which is what I use for
my Epson Stylus), and changed the last entry, like so:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/leftshift.sed.txt">leftshift.sed.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Note that I also add a formfeed (FF or ^L) at the end of the file. This
character is <EM>not</EM> a '^' followed by an 'L' - that won't work! Instead,
use a Real Editor ('vi', or something else that lets you enter raw
characters). In "vi", as an example, press &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; ("raw character
entry") followed by &lt;Ctrl-L&gt; ("formfeed"). Also, you may need more or
fewer spaces than I did; simply adjust that string of spaces in the
beginning of the "sed" expression.

<P>
Eject is of course, the command to spit out the CD that's inside
your system, rather like the Macintosh does.
</P>
<P>
If you're a system admin at a large rack of pretty much the same
machines, you can double-check which one your KVM switch is pointed to
right now... by making it 'eject' and spit out its CD tray.
</P>
<P>
Then it'll be obvious!
</P>
<P>
If you have <EM>ever</EM> rebooted the wrong machine in your server rack or
colo facility, you definitely can use this trick to keep <EM>that</EM> from
happening again

Also handy if you have a habit of ssh'ing into any of several
workstations in your development offices.  You can probably even
hear the whirring of the drive tray.  But don't do it if
you know the boss keeps their coffee in front of the CD bay...

<BR>Mike Orr (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2084%5D%202c%20Tips%20%2311"><em>Linux Gazette</em> Editor</a>)
<BR>Question by Ben Okopnik 

<P><STRONG>
I'd imagine there's someone here who's fairly knowledgeable in Emacs...
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Fairly knowledgeable, no.  Slightly knowledgeable, yes.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
So, I pull down the "Tools" menu, and choose "Read mail". OK,
everything's fine. I exit Emacs, not saving anything... and shortly
thereafter note, with an ice-water-down-the-back shock, that my
"<TT>/var/mail/ben</TT>" is GONE. Zeroed. Empty. WHAT THE FSCK???
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Fortunately, after some seriously POed muttering and high-speed
maneuvers with "find", I thought: "what if Emacs did something weird
with it? It shouldn't have just <EM>deleted</EM> the thing!" So, I open up
Emacs again, "Tools/Read Mail"... and there it is! Big sigh of relief,
and about a dozen blind avenues later I figure out that it stuffed my
mail into a file called "~/RMAIL" and munged the format.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Typical emacs arrogance.  It assumes that its way of handling mail is the
best and that other mail utilities are stupid not to conform.  I had the same
problem when I tried emacs mail in 1990.  And I stopped using emacs mail for
precisely that reason: it didn't handle mail in a way that was compatible with
other mail utilities.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
So, my question to you guys and gals is, is Emacs ALWAYS this bloody
rude? That is horribly intrusive behavior, as I see it: I never
explicitly asked it to change, delete, move, mung, or do anything of the
sort to my mail. I could see where a new user would be totally lost. If
I did something stupid, OK - I'll just be extra-extra cautious of the
beast. If, however, that's Emacs default behavior, I'm deleting it off
my system with extreme prejudice and it shall never darken my STDOUT as
long as I live.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Ben: Emacs is so rude!
</P>
<P>
Emacs: Why didn't you read the FM?
</P>
<P>
Ben: Why didn't you give me a warning the first time I ran it, O Editor
That Calls Itself "Self-Documenting"?  You're the one that's using an
esoteric, incompatible format.
</P>
<P>
Emacs: It was probably the standard format in the environment where emacs
mail was written, and then remain unchanged three decades later.
</P>
<P>
Ben: I'll show you who's boss!!!  I'm going to uninstall you with extreme
prejudice!!
</P>
<P>
Emacs: Bigot!
</P>
<P>
Ben: Bloated piece of crap!  You've got more features than Internet Explorer,
nyaa, nyaa, nyaa!
</P>
<P>
Emacs (Eliza mode): Is the fact that I'm a bloated piece of crap the reason
we're having this conversation?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
&lt;*Splort*&gt; &lt;FOTCL&gt;

<P><STRONG>
Mike, that's one Diet Coke with lemon you owe me. I does <EM>not</EM> belong on
my keyboard, and spraying it out through the nose <EM>hurts</EM>.

<BR>Question by Maria Diaz (Galopwitch from aol.com)


<P><STRONG>
I have a two part question.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
How many root directories can you have in Linux?
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">How deep do you want to chroot?
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">OOOH! Nominated for Answer of the Year.
 -- Ben</font></blockquote>
<P>
[mike]
File systems work a bit differently in linux. There is only ever one
root directoery wich is /
</P>
<P>
All partions or drives are mounted on subdirectories from this root
</P>
<P>
drives and partions are numbered like so
</P>

<blockquote><pre>/dev/hda		first Hard disk
/dev/hdb		second hard disk
/dev/hda1		first partition on first hard disk
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
[SGD]
Basically - it is not possible to have more than one root directory in
the box
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">The real answer is "one at a time"
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">The guys here are correctly describing a normal directory setup.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">However, an application can be working from a deeper directory than the real
one;  that's called a "changed root environment" or chroot and is
actually done all the time by things like Apache and postfix and qmail.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I you have more than one disk drive, what steps do you have to perform in
order to make them available for use.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
[SGD]
what you can do is mount your other harddisk under a subdirectory
for example, if you have <TT>/dev/hdb</TT> as your secondary harddisk, and you
want to use the first partition of that harddisk under linux, just issue
the command
</P>

<blockquote><pre>mount -t &lt;filesystem&gt; /dev/hdb1 &lt;mountpoint&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
here &lt;filesystem&gt; may be vfat (if it's fat32) or ext2, or ext3
&lt;mountpoint&gt; may be any empty directory in your box - usually
/mnt/disk2/
or something like that.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Yup, this is so. You can have lots of partitions, mounted anywhere you
want, including on top of each other, though I don't recommend covering
up any files as they will look like lost space.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">To help make this more readable I made mike and Sayamindu's code
describe the same system.  I use /mnt/c when referring to a C:\ drive,
I think it's nice and memorable.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
[mike]
To eg add a second hard disk you could eg do this
</P>

<blockquote><pre>mkdir /mnt/c
mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/c
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(assuming second drive has been partitioned and formatted)
</P>
<P>
to make this permanent edit the file <TT>/etc/fstab</TT> to add an entry like
this
</P>

<blockquote><pre>/dev/hdb1               /mnt/c                  vfat    defaults     0 0
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
and save the file (please note the above file system is fomatted for w32
- adjust to taste)
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Your response would be greatly appreciated
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanking you in advance

Hello Gang,
</P>
<P>
A while ago, Shreedar V. K. from India asked for a program that would list
the IP addresses for all of his interfaces.  Back then, I joyfully
referred him to one of those Stevens TCP/IP books.  We got quite a thread
from that response.  I like that.
</P>
<P>
I got bored today, so I cranked out a simple program that prints the
interface names with their associated primary IP address.  I intentionally
omitted the display of alias to keep the program simple.  It's really a
quick hack.
</P>
<P>
The purpose is to illustrate why the simple solutions, provided by Ben O.,
really make sense.  Still though, I never turn down a challenge.
Everyone can use and hack it at will.  Just compile the program and
run it.  It takes no command line arguments.  Example output, as well
as the program listing, are displayed below.
</P>
<P>
Good night,
Chris G.
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/interfaces.c.txt">interfaces.c.txt</a></tt></p>

Thanks Mike!  The program kinda shows how much work goes into our beloved

<P><STRONG>
Hi there,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm doing a report for Uni, I was wondering how many subscribers are
there to the Linux Kernel Mailing List? Is there a more popular list?
Estimates are fine.

<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
I have no idea, so the traffic on that list seems rather high (~1000
posts/day).
</P>
<P>
You might want to subscribe and send administrative commands like
"help" "info" and if available "who" which would give you a list of all
subscribed members. These commands depend on the exact mailing-list managing
program but most have these options.

How many of you have been guilty of using mc (midnight
commander), hitting the key sequence "&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt;&lt;?&gt;" before,
and then filling out that nice dialog box to find the file that
you require?? Don't lie, we've all done it (Hi Ben

even know about that feature until you mentioned it.
&lt;grin&gt; So, _now_
I'll be guilty of it - maybe. I'm pretty used to
"find" by now, and

Oh no, Ben. I simply meant that as you keep promoting
the use of "mc" for things like: rpm viewing, tar/gz
viewing, etc, it was logical (?) to assume that you'd
have used the "find" feature occasionally?

of kudos for this one.

I had installed RedHAt 7.0 It was working perfectly fine. One fine day I

Check your securetty file, or PAM.  Either of them could suggest to the
system that root cannot be trusted to login from where you are at.

<P>
If it were a regular user, but root could login, I'd suggest checking
if the nologin file is present.
</P>
<P>
You could also be on a system that cannot handle passwords longer than
8 characters, but be trying to work with a longer password, or be using
something that is not shadow-aware while your password is stored in the
shadow file.  This used to cause trouble when Gnome was much younger.

Hotshot, your question has been forwarded to the Linux Gazette Answer
Gang.  <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> is a web-based magazine hosted by the same
publisher as <EM>Linux Journal</EM>.  I greet you as the editor in charge of
the monthly column.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I took a brief look at the internet search engines to see what you
appeared to be talking about.  There's apparently a company offering
software which turns your computer into a phone, provided that it's
plugged into a phone line and you have a full service sound card.
It also looks like "2.9 cents a minute" comes up a lot.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are a lot of internet-phone applications - voice conferencing
is especially popular.  If you type "phone" as a keyword into the
application search engine at <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A> (<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net"
	>http://freshmeat.net</A>) you'll
have about 250 projects to check on.  You may want to start at the
category : Communications :: Internet Phone.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for the 2.9 cents a minute that just depends how they implemented it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockQuote><ul>
<LI>Maybe you just need the right long-distance provider - theirs -
   in which case, you might want to find out who that is and sign up
   with them so you gain even when you use a handset.

<LI>Maybe their software implements some magic protocol, in which case,
   your question is perfect, except that you don't know what their
   protocol is called.

<LI>If it's called H.323 lots of folks use it for voice conferencing
   applications, and yes, we have OpenH.323 programs coming out of our
   ears.
</ul></blockQuote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My suggestion would be to contact the folks who make the "ordinary"
PC2Phone software and ask them the same question - is it available for
Linux, and if not, what is the protocol used.  If the protocol is an
open standard, note it down, and ask them what settings you'll need to
set your Linux software to, in order to enjoy their service.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Good luck in your quest.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[jra] 
I believe you mean "client software for a voice over Internet phone

[Forwarding to LQO as a 2-cent tip.  Anyone want to write such a script or write
an article about it?]
</P>
<P>
The original message was a spam promoting commercial software that would scrub
your (Windows) system of "offensive content" (pornography, drug references,
terrorism references) you may have accidentally dreged up while websurfing.
</P>
<P>
Part of the scare tactics it mentioned is a claim that you can get convicted
for child pornography merely for visiting a site once that has child porn pics
on the home page, even if you didn't know the nature of the site beforehand, or
3rd-party Javascript sent you there without your approval, or you never saw
the pictures in the visible portion of the window.  This =&gt; cached porn pics on
your HD =&gt; discoverable evidence of a crime =&gt; why you need this commercial
program.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
[tag-admin] 
Speak right up, what's the best way to delete offensive content that may have
been automatically saved on your hard disk while you were websurfing?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Can you say, "Open the preferences/settings dialog and press the 'Empty Disk
Cache' button?"  I knew you could.

[Don Marti] 
What about history and cookies?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A script to clean all traces of web activity from your .mozilla
directory (except cookies from sites you like) would be an interesting
exercise.  All of these files seems to have some potentially
"incriminating" info in them:

<BR>Question by Lon Diffenderfer (profitrocket from nmax.net)


<!-- ::
At a loss for words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:: -->
<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My name is Lon Diffenderfer. I am looking for a way to convert some very
important files created by my father in SCO Lyrix into a .txt file. Is this
a simple procedure or will I need a the help of a professional? Is there a
file conversion program that I can purchase or download that would be able
to handle this job? I thank you in advance for your time and assistance.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Best Regards,
<BR>Lon Diffenderfer
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ashwin] 
Now can you please elaborate on what kind of files these are?
Knowing the file format will be essential ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
Ashwin, I agree with you that the filetype is
important. Indeed, Lon could acheive this by issuing
the command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>file /path/to/file
</font></code></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
and then reporting it back to us. This would, as
Ashwin has said, help us in determining which
program(s) to use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[jra] 
Lyrix was a third-party word processor which ran under Xenix.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
SCO bought it (or it's resale rights), and I haven't seen it in years.
I strongly suspect that you're going to have to hunt up copies of both
Xenix and Lyrix to open those files...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Frank] 
... Lyrix was once known as Unixplex, I seem to remember.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
While I don't know exactly anymore, I seem to remember that it was
always one line of text, followed by a line of formatting code below it,
each line ending with a &lt;CR&gt;, a new paragraph is signaled by an empty
line.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Rick] 
be aware that at least two other software efforts have borne
the name Lyrix: a computer-telephony product from Lyrix Systems, Inc.,
and early versions of the excellent TeX-based graphical document
processor subsequently renamed "LyX".)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas Adams] 
But in most cases, I would recommend the use of the
program: "strings", which trys to report back useful
"character literal" information. You could try issuing
the command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>strings file | less
</font></code></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
where "file" is the file that you are trying to view.
(I've piped it through to "less" for convenience,
although:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>strings file &gt;&amp; ~/some_file
</font></code></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
is perhaps better if you want to store the
information)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
N.B. Strings does work on ELF files, but the result is
somewhat unpredictable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Frank Rodolf] 
Lon, if all you need is the text portion, you should do quite nicely
with the strings command, as Thomas writes above.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I heard rumors that there has been some conversion utility (lyrix2wrd,
or something like that), but when a friend of mine needed that a while
ago, I was unable to find it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR width="10%" align="center"><P><STRONG>
To all who replied, "THANK YOU!"
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
You're welcome!!!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm glad that people such as Jay, and myself, were of
some use. Makes a change actually!!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He he....
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
With the information you provided, I was able to find a local professional
who had administered Xenix systems in years past and was able to use
"strings" to recover the data. I still do not understand exactly what he
did, but I am elated and very grateful to your group for your assistance. If
this is the kind of help I can get for Linux, maybe it's time to learn it
and switch.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[jra] 
Probably.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Outstanding; glad to ehar you got your data back.  Now you understand
why Unix people (and especially Linux people) are fond of textual
configuration and data files whenever possible...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What he <EM>did</EM> was to use the Unix strings(1) program, which sifts
through a [random] file looking for strings of characters that appear
to be ASCII text, extracting them from the surrounding (binary) data,
and printing them on it's output.  Once you do that, it's usually just
a cleanup pass.

Remember: GRUB numbers partitions from ZERO while linux counts from ONE
So:

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br> 	root (hd0,0)
<br>	kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br> 	root (hd0,5)
<br>	kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda6
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
... note how GRUB's (hd0,0) is Linux' <TT>/dev/hda1</TT> and GRUB's
(hd0,5) is Linux' <TT>/dev/hda6</TT>

1. is it possible load linux as 3rd os on my system( ii ) ?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sayan] 
Well, of course it is. Provided you have the required amount of space left
on your hard disk to install the packages that you need. You see while
installing multiple operating systems you have to follow the rule "stupidest
os first". So up till now you have not gone wrong. So go ahead and install
Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Yes.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">The usual way is to clear some space for it (Partition Magic, parted,
or FIPS are most commonly used) and then install Linux in the empty
space.  For Redhat to be the installed flavor you'd need to do this.
With some other flavors of Linux (Slackware's "bigslack" for example)
you would need to set aside some space, but you wouldn't need to adjust
the partition types first.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">If LILO replaces your master boot record, and your kernel is on the same
disk, LILO should have no problem selecting among all three operating
systems.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">If you use LOADLIN.EXE from inside either of your Windows environments,
and make a copy of the Linux kernel visible in your drive, you could add
an entry to your mswin boot menu for Linux.

2. after installation how the dos partition drives can be mounted as the
system starts.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">In the file /etc/fstab add an entry for the mountpoint which you'd like
to use, and tell it that the filesystem type is vfat instead of ext2.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">I like to use /mnt/c, myself, and set aside /mnt/a for using DOS
floppies ... that is, if I don't simply use mtools commands.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">THe LSB tells us that /mnt is expected to be used for temporary mounts,
though, so you might prefer /home/c-drive or something like that.

Secure Mounting for DOS Partitions:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
In order to open up permissions on your DOS partitions in a secure way, do
the following:
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: in the samples below, the dos usrid (63) and grpid(63) were selected
so they wouldn't duplicate any other usrid or grpid in <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> or
/etc/group.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Also, this solution works with <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 5.1, you may have to adjust it
slightly if you are using a different distribution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Make a dos user who can't log in by adding the following line to
/etc/passwd: dos:*:63:63:MSDOS Accessor:/dos:


<LI>Make a dos group and add users to the dos group. In the following
example, root and ejy are in the dos group. To do this, add a line like the
following to /etc/group: dos::63:root,ejy


<LI>Add the following line (changed to suit your system) to

   /etc/fstab:
     /dev/hda1  /C      vfat    uid=63,gid=63,umask=007 0 0
</ol></blockQuote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, you have to locate your DOS partitions in the first place. This
is done by issuing the following commands as 'root':
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>     /sbin/fdisk -l
     df
     cat /etc/fstab
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The `fdisk -l` command lists all available devices. `df` shows which devices
are mounted and how much is on them. And <TT>/etc/fstab</TT> lists all mountable
devices. The devices remaining are extended partitions, a kind of a
partition envelope, which you don't want to mount. And the partition's
allocated to other operating systems which you may want to mount.
4) Create a mount point for your DOS disk by issuing the following commands
as root: mkdir <TT>/C</TT> chown dos:dos <TT>/C</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With this setup, the C: drive is mounted at boot time to <TT>/C.</TT> Only root and
ejy can read and write to it. Note that vfat in <TT>/etc/fstab</TT> works for vfat16
(and vfat32 natively for Linux 2.0.34 and above).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Enjoy...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE><BLOCKQUOTE>
So you see you can always access your dos files SECURELY from Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="#000066">You may already have such a user, for dosemu or wine
for example.
</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="#000066">
You can reuse one of that sort, as long as you're sure you are assigning
a similar privilege.  Also, you want to avoid making a userid that will 
classh with something else;  if all else fails pick something above 65000.

3. i am bit more confused while installing linux  so please kindly send
me the procedure how to install linux on the system in step by step method.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sayan] 
Big question, demands big answer. Maybe some other more experienced person
in the List will be able to give better answer. But I hope you will have no
probs trying to installl Redhat. But why do you want 7.1 when 8 has become
available. Try to get a copy of the latest distro from your local LUG (Linux
Users Group). They are always very helpful. If you can send us your
location, somebody can give you the contacts of your nearest LUG. And, these
new distros are soooo easy to install, you just cant go wrong.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">The commercial package of Red Hat comes with a fine set of manuals.  In
addition you could get the current version; they've gotten up to 7.3
now.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">But if you're going to buy it you might also compare with Mandrake or
SuSE and get whichever looked best to you.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Most things that you would expect, many that you wouldn't, and for
almost any package, source code if you need it, or some particular
programmers to go ask for more features.

<P><STRONG>
important things in linux. do's and donot's.one more thing
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Mmm, donuts.  Important things to do:
</font></blockquote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Have fun.  The computer is supposed to be your tool, not your boss.

<LI>Be willing to read README files, and HOWTO documents.  Linux is all
   about becoming more self reliant.  Search engines are expecially
   handy.

<LI>Once you've learned, help others with stuff that you understand.  It
   improves the community.

<LI>The perl motto "There's More Than One Way To Do It" also applies to
   most activities in Linux.  If there isn't, probably some college
   student somewhere is working on another way, but hasn't gotten around
   to releasing their code yet.

<LI>(NOT SPECIFIC TO LINUX) make backups!  Whenever things are looking
   good, make a good copy of how it is;  that way you always have
   something good to come back to if later things go haywire.  I
   recommend a good backup of your present windows setups before you go
   ahead with your Linux setup, for example.
</ol></blockQuote>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Important Don'ts: </font></blockquote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Don't despair.  We agree that not everyone's advances in self reliance
   will include becoming a programmer type.  There are web sites dedicated
   to Linux newbies, and to specific topics as well.  There are also IRC
   channels to talk to people across the internet live about this, and
   mailing lists, and newsgroups.

<LI>Don't send HTML attachments to mailing lists;  some people get grumpy
   about it.  (Don't worry, I snipped it.)
</ol></blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
i have worked in linux in my college on a system with windows nt
i want to how to connect the two os.thank u,muthu

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Samba is the usual way.  It lets Linux look like yet another Windows
box with active shares, as far as its Microsoft-y neighbors are
concerned.  See <A HREF="http://www.samba.org"
