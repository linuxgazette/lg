Hello list,
</p>

<p>
I have configured a samba server which is a standalone file and printer
sharing samba. I have no problem to use it from Linux. but strange
problem from WinXP box. First of all the XP machine wait long to reach
the share and though a mapdrive is possible to create for the share; it
is immediately <strong>Disconnected</strong> after a reboot of the XP. More over a
connected mapdrive lost its share path after approx 2 hrs. I am really
very confused to see these strange problem in XP box.

Hello,
</p>

<p>
Is there anyone using icewm+idesk combination ? I have seen that
wallpaper support is already there in idesk; more over changing the wall
paper from a source folder is also possible. But is it all theory ? I
can't get the wallpaper working in box. I am using idesk  0.7.5-4.
</p>

<p>
Any success from anyone ?

It's been an interesting experience. We're at the midterm evaluations
now, and 8 of our 9 students look like they'll pass - I know I gave my
student a glowing review, which is no less than he deserves. The
student who looks like likely to fail leaves a bit of a bad taste in
our mouths, because he not only was a member of our community
beforehand, but a few of us specifically talked him into it, and heck,
we got drunk with him at a workshop in Dublin. Barring the (frankly,
unlikely) scenario that he has actually been busily working away in
some remote location without 'net access, I hope he'll do the
honourable thing and bow out gracefully - I don't think any of us
particularly like being in the position of having to choose between
either feeling like we've betrayed this guy in some way or that we've
helped him to steal money from Google.
</p>

<p>
But, all in all, it's been an interesting experience so far, and one
that I'd recommend to anyone.

Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I have become confused about the domain name handling in debian. I have
a suse box too. It is very easy to set the domain name in suse box "
domainname &lt;example.com&gt; ". Similarly to set FQDN in suse " hostname
&lt;hostname&gt;.&lt;example.com&gt;"
</p>

<p>
How to achieve this in debian ? No domainname command is there in debian
(lenny). There are /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname but where can I save
<strong>domain</strong> name ? and where to save FQDN ? I am really confused here.
Please enlighten me. Thanks.

Hello list,
</p>

<p>
I have upgraded my box to debian squeeze. And discover ffmpeg stops
converting to .mp3 . I have libmp3lame installed ; more over it was
running well before up-gradation. After doing some google serach I have
found that libmp3lame support has been disabled in official debian
package. Then I have found multimedia.debia.org repo where the ffmpeg is
distributed with less strict license policy. but again vlc now broken
after adding that repo in my sources.lst and updating due to library
collision. 
</p>

<p>
Is there any repo which provides the ffmpeg with mp3 support and still
maintain the official debian naming scheme ?  then I can use both vlc as
well as ffmpeg.
</p>

<p>
Thanks

Kindly cc to me

Dear Mr. James T. Dennis,
</p>

<p>
I read of your article on the web "The Answer Guy" and I think you can
help me with my application.
</p>

<p>
I need help to write a program to sort out of some of my e-mail and auto
response to buttons " accept" or "decline". I am not a dot generation
and it will require too much efforts to start from the beginning. I am
asking some one will write the application for me for a
fee(appreciation). Can you help? Or, can you assign someone else to
help? I use the regular hotmail in the window environment.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; These attributes are used by the quota management system, which I didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; describe in the article. It is basically a web-based GUI where
&gt;&gt;&gt; administrators can change these values. Some scripts read the quota
&gt;&gt;&gt; values from the LDAP directory and write it to the Cyrus server by using
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Cyrus Perl API. mailSizeMax isn't used in the setup, but again it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was supposed to be.
&gt;&gt; Is the management system based off your "cyrus_syncboxes.pl"? Could you 
&gt;&gt; describe the system you used?
&gt; 
&gt; The management system consists of a couple of Perl scripts.
&gt; cyrus_syncboxes.pl only synchronises the mail quota settings from the
&gt; LDAP tree with the settings on the Cyrus server. The other scripts are
&gt; CGIs and part of a web management UI. Admins can create, delete and
&gt; modify accounts. A rough overview over the functionality can be found
&gt; here:
&gt; <a href='http://web.luchs.at/information/docs/mailadmin_prozesse.pdf'>http://web.luchs.at/information/docs/mailadmin_prozesse.pdf</a>
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to publish the scripts as soon as I got the time to review
&gt; the code and remove everything specific to the servers they manage.
&gt; 
&gt; 
</pre>
Rene,
</p>

<p>
Did you ever get around to publishing the scripts mentioned above?
</p>

<p>
What web management UI are you using? Was it something like phpldapadmin 
or some custom job?
</p>

<p>
What webmail system are you using with this setup?
</p>


<p>
Cheers,
Peter.

Hi!
</p>

<p>
I use PPP to use a GPRS and/or CDMA modem. The 'pppd' often dies
abruptly, blurting out "modem has hung up".
</p>

<p>
I am not suspecting a network issue as it doesn't happen on Windows.
Any idea how can I find out the reason and may be then correct it ?

<p>
Thanks!

Ah, yes;  or simply quote the file names as follows:

    fs=`echo "$line" | cut -f 1 -d':'`

    while [ -f "$fn" -a $j -lt 10 ]; do

IFS also makes sense.  Thanks for highlighting this rather serious error.  I

Whenever I have trouble booting a distro, I disable "quiet" and "splash"
options, so I can see text indicating a problem, or at least telling me
how far the boot got.  
</p>

<p>
On our Dell C400, I boot by adding the boot options:
noapic nolapic acpi=off vga=771

<p>
I've never met a distro that can't boot the C400 with those added.

<p>
For those who needs quick help on number conversion between base-x to
base-y, bc can lend a help here. For example, what's the hexadecimal
form of 116?:
<pre>
$ echo 'obase=16; 116' | bc
74
</pre>

<p>
And what does binary 11010101 look in decimal?
<pre>
$ echo 'ibase=2; 11010101' | bc
213
</pre>

<p>
By doing below step, you directly convert binary 11010101 to hexadecimal:
<pre>
$ echo 'obase=16; ibase=2; 11010101' | bc
D5
</pre>

<p>
Note that "obase" must preced "ibase" in order to make a correct final result.

<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SUN Approves Oracle Merger, Cancels "Rock"</h3>
<p>At a special meeting on July 16, 2009, Sun Microsystems stockholders 
adopted the merger agreement with Oracle Corporation, under which 
Oracle will acquire Sun common stock for $9.50 per share (or $7.4 
billion). Approximately 62% of Sun shares outstanding voted for the 
deal.</p>

<p>The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals 
and other closing conditions. For more informawtion regarding the 
proposed transaction, please visit 
<a
href="http://www.sun.com/third-party/global/oracle/">http://www.sun.com/third-party/global/oracle/</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Sun has been reported as cancelling its multi-billion dollar 
"Rock" program, which was based on a new third-generation SPARC 
architecture for high-end systems. Sun had said the next SPARC 
processor was part of its plan to compete with PowerPC and x86 chips.</p>

<p>Rock was designed with 16 cores, each of which had two software 
threads. Rock used hardware-based dynamic parallelization of the 
instruction stream, and would have been the first processor to use 
transactional memory in hardware.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">NY Times Releases Thesaurus to Linked Data Cloud, FOSS Data Converter</h3>

<p>At a keynote presentation at the 2009 Semantic Technology Conference,
in San Jose, California, staff from the <em>New York Times</em> made a 
significant announcement regarding use of the NYT Annotated Corpus and 
the NYT Index in the "Linked Data Cloud".</p>

<p>For nearly 100 years, the staff at the <em>New York Times</em> have
maintained a thesaurus for use with its content. The thesaurus consists
of more than a million terms organized into five controlled
vocabularies: subjects, personal names, organizations, geographic
locations, and the titles of creative works (books, movies, plays,
etc).</p>

<p>At the June Semantic Technology Conference, Rob Larson and Evan Sandhaus
announced their intention to publish the <em>New York Times</em>
thesaurus under a license that will allow the community to both use it
and contribute back to it. The results will, in time, prepare the <em>New
York Times</em> to enter the global linked data cloud, by releasing its
thesaurus in linked data format.</p>

<p>Releasing the <em>Times</em> thesaurus is consistent with their developing 
TimesOpen strategy. In a blog entry at the <em>Times's</em> "Open" site, 
Larson and Sandhaus wrote, "We want to facilitate access to slices of 
our data for those who want to include <em>Times</em> content in their 
applications. Our TimesTags API already makes available our most 
frequently used tags, the 27,000 that power our topics pages. But the 
new effort will go well beyond that. We plan to release hundreds of 
thousands of tags from the corpus back to 1980, and, later, in a second 
phase, hundreds of thousands more, going back to 1851."</p>

<p>Their plan is that user and Semantic Technology communities will begin 
to link the <em>NY Times</em> thesaurus to new and existing taxonomies, and 
eventually help standardize the use of those terms on the World Wide 
Web.</p>

<p>The specific license details remain to be worked out, but will be based 
on one or more existing open source licenses.</p>

<p>Also, in June, the <em>NY Times</em> released a PHP framework called 
NYT_Transformer.  This is a flexible open source data converter that 
can be customized for various input and output types.</p>

<p>NYT_Transformer accepts records from an input source, passes them 
through filters, and sends them to an output object. It can also 
perform further data manipulation, such as changing the data in the 
resulting records or discarding records based on criteria specified.  
It was originally developed to convert XML data for storage in a MySQL 
database. NYT_Transformer uses the Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">RHEL 5.4 Beta Now Available</h3>
<p>Early in July, Red Hat released the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 beta 
(kernel-2.6.18-155.el5), with versions for x86, x86/64, Itanium, IBM 
POWER, and System z. This RHEL beta release includes a variety of new 
features and capabilities, combined with enhancements in 
virtualization, storage/filesystems, security, and developer tools.</p>

<p>The most exciting new capability in the RHEL 5.4 beta is the 
incorporation of KVM-based virtualization, in addition to existing 
Xen-based virtualization. RHEL 5.4 provides the first 
commercial-strength implementation of KVM, which is developed as part 
of the upstream Linux kernel. Xen-based virtualization, of course, 
remains fully supported for the life of the RHEL 5 family. Red Hat 
also announced the availability of the beta release of the Red Hat 
Enterprise Virtualization portfolio, which includes Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization Manager for Servers, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 
Manager for Desktops, and the standalone, KVM-based Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization Hypervisor.</p>

<p>An important feature of any RHEL update is that kernel and user APIs 
are unchanged, so that RHEL 5 applications do not need to be rebuilt 
or re-certified. This situation extends to virtualized environments: 
with a fully integrated hypervisor, the application binary interface 
(ABI) consistency offered by RHEL means that applications certified to 
run on RHEL on physical machines are also certified when run in 
virtual machines. The portfolio of thousands of certified applications 
for RHEL applies to both environments.</p>

<p>Here are some additional highlights:</p>

<h4>Virtualization Enhancements</h4>

<ul>
<li> KVM hypervisor;
<li> Hardware support (SRIOV, IOMMU, VT-d):<br />
With this release, Red Hat is introducing support for SRIOV 
(Single Root I/O for Virtualization). This feature aims to 
improve transaction throughput performance in virtual 
environments, by taking advantage of PCI cards that can be shared 
by multiple virtual machines at one time without creating a 
throughput bottleneck. These throughput improvements combine 
with previous CPU and memory performance enhancements to allow 
customers to further consolidate workloads to lower their costs. 
SRIOV works with either IOMMU or VT-d, in AMD and Intel platforms,
respectively;
<li> VDI SPICE protocol enablers:<br />
This software, unique to Red Hat, offers better response times 
for graphic/screen rendering by adaptively taking advantage of 
either client or host capabilities. This leads to better CPU 
usage, enabling improved VDI consolidation ratios, without 
the need for expensive special hardware;
<li> Libvirt:<br />
perl interface for libvirt (new);
<li> Kernel:<br />
Improved clock management when RHEL is deployed on a VMware 
platform.
</ul>

<h4>Storage/FileSystem</h4>

<ul>
<li> New Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) utilities for management 
of FC instances on Ethernet;<br />
<li> Clustered Samba (Technology Preview.)</p>
</ul>

<h4>Security</h4>

<ul>
<li> RHEL 5.4 is a FIPS-140 certification target.
</ul>
<h4>Developer/Sysadmin</h4>

<ul>
<li> Kernel tracepoints (Technology Preview), coupled with tracepoint 
support in SystemTap. This release provides user-space backtrace 
support, complementing kernel-space backtracing that was provided 
in previous releases. SystemTap provides a powerful, comprehensive 
performance troubleshooting tool;<br />
<li> New CIM support for DHCP services.
</ul>

<p>For full details on the new features in the RHEL 5.4 beta release,

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">TopQuadrant Offers Free Semantic Web Modeling Tool</h3>
<p>TopQuadrant, a major player in Semantic Web application development 
technology, released TopBraid Composer Free Edition, a professional 
editing and querying tool for Semantic Web technology that allows 
users to view, share, and query RDF data. TopBraid Composer Free 
Edition is a starter version of TopBraid Composer, a leading 
commercial Semantic Web modeling tool.</p>

<p>Technical users can build enterprise-class semantic models, design and 
edit semantic queries, create semantic business rules, and share their 
creations with others for free. Users can also import RDFa markup used 
to publish machine-readable data on the Web. TopBraid Composer Free 
Edition simplifies the process of linking business logic to domain 
models by providing an object-oriented rule model. </p>

<p>"There is fast-growing interest from all industries to understand the 
unique data quality, data integration, and dynamic discovery benefits 
that Semantic Web technology has to offer," said Holger Knublauch, VP 
of product development at TopQuadrant. "But we recognize that 
unfamiliarity with W3C Semantic Web standards and cost are two 
obstacles prohibiting many organizations from starting a Semantic Web 
project. By offering a free version of our modeling environment, we 
are removing these barriers."  Knublauch is a co-creator of Owl, and 
joined TopQuadrant a few years ago.</p>

<p>TopBraid Composer Free Edition shortens the learning curve for 
starting Semantic Web projects by using Eclipse, a popular open source 
development environment that is familiar to a broad set of developers. 
In addition to support for W3C standards such as RDF, OWL, and SPARQL, 
TopBraid Composer Free Edition also includes SPIN (SPARQL Inferencing 
Notation), the first Semantic Web language with an explicit 
object-oriented rule model that can link business logic and domain 
models. SPIN eliminates the need to learn OWL to link RDF resources 
with associated queries or to reuse queries.</p>

<p>TopBraid Composer Free Edition offers all of the functionality needed 
to view, share and query RDF data in an enterprise-class Semantic Web 
project. Users can:</p>

<ul>
<li> Load, edit and save RDF files in RDF/XML, N3 and N-triple files;
<li> Define ontologies using form-based editors;
<li> Create and execute SPARQL queries;
<li> Create and execute SPIN rules;
<li> Import RDFa markup from Web pages.
</ul>

<p>NASA recently announced it is using TopBraid Suite 3.0 as a semantic 
application platform to model, organize, integrate, and exchange data 
within and across the multi-decade Constellation Program. NASA's use 
of TopBraid Suite is a significant commitment to using a semantic data 
architecture in the full "engineering-through-operations" lifecycle to 
achieve the Constellation Program's ambitious planetary exploration 
goals, which include manned travel to Mars.</p>

<p>More specifically, NASA will use TopBraid to develop and manage NExIOM 
- the NASA Exploration Initiatives Ontology models. NExIOM formalizes 
the way machines and people specify NASA Exploration systems, related 
work activities, and their interrelationships.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Keynote Releases New Monitoring Services</h3>
<p>At the Velocity 2009 conference in June, Keynote announced Keynote 
Transaction Perspective 9.0, a much enhanced version of the company's 
Web site monitoring service, for "Next Web" applications.</p>
 
<p>Umang Gupta, CEO of Keynote, announced the new SaaS-like solution in 
front of 600 people at the O'Reilly event.  A video of his short 
announcement and demo is available here: 
<a href="http://velocityconference.blip.tv/file/2280364">http://velocityconference.blip.tv/file/2280364</a>.</p>

<p>Transaction Perspective 9.0 includes new support for interactive Flash 
and Silverlight, composite Web transactions, and 3rd party online ad 
tracking.</p>

<p>In April, Keynote Systems introduced LoadPro 2.0, which enhanced its 
load-testing tools in support of user metrics or Quality of Experience 
(QoE). Keynote has already established strengths in QoE-related 
testing with a strong "human face," including insights into business 
competitiveness globally, as well as domain and consulting expertise 
in how consumers interact with Internet services.</p>

<p>EMA (<a href="http://www.enterprisemanagement.com/">http://www.enterprisemanagement.com/</a>), a leading market research 
analyst firm, wrote a very positive note on Keynote LoadPro 2.0.  The 
new version includes a new end user portal, an expansive overview 
dashboard, precise visibility into real time tests as they execute, 
and comprehensive enterprise-level account management. The new 
functionality is built on top of a dedicated load testing network that 
can deliver up to one million concurrent test users across multiple 
Internet backbones.

<p>Recent research from EMA in December, 2008, established that 79% of 
the 207 respondents view QoE as becoming more important to their 
business or organization. QoE demands a focus on the "human consumer" 
in all his or her complexities, rather than on more convenient, but 
far less relevant, component-centric technology metrics.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sourcefire Releases Virtual Appliances for Physical and Virtual 
Environments</h3>

<p>Sourcefire, creator of Snort, announced Sourcefire 3D System 4.9, with 
the new Sourcefire Virtual 3D Sensor and Sourcefire Virtual Defense 
Center. These new virtual appliances enable users to deploy the 
company's security solutions within their virtual environments. 
Available during the second half of 2009, the Sourcefire 3D System 4.9 
also features the industry's first policy layering capabilities that 
deliver increased customization for large or multi-organizational 
networks, including cloud or virtual implementations.</p>

<p>As part of the Sourcefire 3D System 4.9, the new virtual appliances 
allow organizations to inspect traffic between virtual machines, while 
also making it easier to deploy and manage sensors at remote sites,
where resources may be limited. They also enable Managed Security 
Service Providers (MSSPs) and cloud computing companies to easily 
implement Sourcefire's leading security solutions for increased 
protection. MSSPs can configure multiple Virtual Defense Centers to 
support multiple customers from a single VMware server, increasing the 
efficiency of management efforts.</p>

<p>Users can deploy Virtual 3D Sensors on VMware ESX and ESXi platforms 
to inspect traffic between two or more virtual machines (VMs), while 
also using physical Sourcefire 3D Sensors to inspect traffic going 
into and out of a VMware virtual environment. Deployed as software 
running within VMs, the Virtual 3D Sensor also makes it easier for 
users to inspect traffic on remote segments of the network where local 
IT security resources may not exist (e.g., retail stores, remote 
offices) or where little rack space remains in the datacenter.</p>

<p>The Virtual 3D Sensor will provide simultaneous execution of 
Sourcefire IPS, RNA (Real-time Network Awareness) and RUA (Real-time 
User Awareness) functions. Customers can deploy the Virtual Defense 
Center to monitor any combination of up to 25 virtual or physical 3D 
Sensors. They can also opt to monitor their Virtual 3D Sensors from 
the same physical Defense Center they use to monitor their physical 3D 
Sensors.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sourcefire 3D System v4.9 Will Be Available in
Second Half of 2009</h3>

<p>The new Version of VNC Enterprise provides cross-platform remote
printing. In June, RealVNC launched the latest version of its enterprise
VNC solution for remote desktop control. VNC Enterprise Edition 4.5 offers
fully cross-platform remote printing, enabling users to print documents
from the remote machine to the local default printer on the VNC Viewer.
Other new features include enhanced cross-platform chat, support for
international characters, and more robust performance.</p>
 
<p>Designed and built by the original inventors of VNC, VNC Enterprise 
Edition 4.5 has a wide range of applications - from desktop support and 
assistance in a business environment to delivering Linux and Unix 
applications to Windows or Mac users. Also, because it is designed 
specifically for the enterprise, it includes multiple configurable 
security mechanisms, and is backed up with full technical support and 
maintenance. </p>
 
<p>Cross-platform remote printing means that when a connection is made, 
documents printed by the remote computer running VNC Server will 
automatically default to the local printer attached to the computer 
running VNC Viewer.</p>
 
<p>VNC Enterprise Edition 4.5 also supports cross-platform chat, creating 
a quick and simple channel of communication between users, which can 
be initiated from either end. VNC Server can now notify users of 
incoming connections for added security.</p>
 
<p>VNC Enterprise Edition 4.5 includes tools for wide-scale distributed 
deployment, configuration, and management, and supports more operating 
systems than any other remote access software, including Windows NT 4, 
2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Windows 7, along with 
Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX.</p>
 
<p>The cost of VNC Enterprise Edition 4.5 starts at $50 for a single 
VNC Server licence, with discounted volume pricing starting at three 
copies, quickly reducing the unit price. In addition, there are 
generous academic, governmental and non-profit discounts available on 
request.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">HP Ships Workstation with Dual 6-core 'Istanbul' Opteron CPUs</h3>

<p>HP is now outfitting AMD's six-core "Istanbul" Opteron processor into 
its high-end HP xw9400 workstation, aimed at 3-D digital content 
creation, and science and engineering applications.</p>

<p>HP officials say the troubled economy is putting pressure on 
businesses to quickly get a return on their IT investments, which the 
new AMD Opteron chips enable due to new virtualization, performance, 
and efficiency enhancements.  Each new Opteron chip has up to 34 
percent more performance per watt over AMD's previous quad-core 
processors. </p>

<p>The HP xw9400 workstation can seat two of the chips, for a total of 12 
cores.</p>

<p>HP also announced in June that of seven ProLiant G6 servers would be 
powered by new AMD six-core Opteron processors, which were officially 
released June 1.</p>

<p>Other Features Include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Enabling up to 4 3D displays, the HP xw9400 provides scalable 
visualization capability. Native PCIe x16 dual ports support 
high-end graphics and SLI-enablement. The 2 PCI-X 100 slots can be 
configured as a single PCI-X 133 slot to meet some Independent 
Hardware Vendors' (IHVs) requirements;<br />

<li> Large SCSI/SAS HDD capacity - The HP xw9400 offers 8 channel 
Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), the latest, highest performance disk 
subsystem. The 8 channels provide dedicated bandwidth to each SAS 
hard drive allowing for an optional external SAS connection to 
support external storage arrays, while still providing maximum 
internal storage capability;<br />

<li> With integrated SAS or SATA RAID controllers, the HP xw9400 provides 
RAID 0 (disk mirroring for fault tolerance) and RAID 1 (disk striping 
for high data bandwidth to and from a disk array) support. Optional 
RAID 10 (striping + mirroring) and RAID 5 (striping + parity for 
additional data integrity) is available through an add-in PCI card.
</ul>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Cisco Launches Linux WiFi Router with Media Sharing</h3>

<p>In June, Cisco announced a new Linux-powered router, a Linksys 
Wireless-N Router, model WRT160NL. The new model is essentially the 
next generation of the popular WRT54GL.</p>

<p>The design of the product is similar to other Linksys/Cisco N-routers, 
but has integrated connectors for external antennae. Consumers that 
prefer external aerials can enjoy the new router design because of the 
integrated R-SMA antenna connectors. The integrated Storage Link 
functionality lets consumers connect their USB storage device to the 
router to create a powerful media sharing solution for video, photo, 
and music sharing through the integrated media server. </p>

<p>"In the past we have had many successful Linux powered devices, with 
the WRT54GL and NSLU2 being great examples. The WRT160NL is the 
logical next step combining Linux, 802.11n technology, and USB storage 
functionality. We see the WRT160NL as a possible successor of our 
WRT54GL as the market transitions to 802.11n," said Aaron Marinari, 
senior product manager, Cisco Consumer Business Group.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<li> The Storage Link port lets users connect USB storage devices to the 
router. The media server can stream to PCs orUPnP AV digital media 
adapters and supports FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS file systems.<br />
<li> Although most Linksys routers feature internal antennae, the 
WRT160NL also has external antennae to be more flexible in antennae 
choice and placement.<br />
<li> The new packaging provides a 40% reduction in waste materials and 
is made from 80% recycled content.</ul>

<p>The WRT160NL has a 400Mhz processor, 8 Megabytes of Flash memory, and 
32 Megabytes of DDRAM.  It will retail for $119.99.</p>

<h1>Away Mission: JavaOne, SemTech, and Velocity</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
In June, there were three great conferences within three very different
spheres of the computer technology. One of these, JavaOne, is a 
long-time major conference. However, this may be the last year with
a separate JavaOne: Oracle has been sweeping the user conferences of
its new acquisitions into its own Oracle OpenWorld user conference, and
Java development is already highlighted at OpenWorld. 
</p>

<p>
The other two are up-and-coming conferences with very technical
audiences. However, each is also recommended and well regarded in its
own community.
</p>

<!-- this should probably say, in LG#161-->
<p>
For the April <em>LG</em>, I noted O'Reilly's Velocity: Web Performance
and Operations Conference, in comparison to Web 2.0 Expo. The name
says it all. It's aimed at technical people, mostly sysadmins, while Web
2.0 Expo focuses on Web-page developers and related marketing efforts.
Basically, there is no comparison, and the better sessions from Web 2.0
Expo will be presented at Velocity. Readers of <em>Linux Gazette</em>
will feel more comfortable here, and will get their technical questions
answered. 
</p>

<p>
Velocity brings together the go-to people from companies like Google,
Facebook, Microsoft, eBay, etc., who present the best current
performance and operations work for the Web.
</p>

<p>
Steve Souders, co-chair of Velocity, is back, and will present the
update to his SRO talk, Even Faster Web Sites, renamed this year to
Website Performance Analysis, on the best practices he developed while
working as a Performance Engineer at both Google and Yahoo. That
improved presentation is the kickoff talk this year. 
</p>

<p>
One talk I intend to catch this year is "Fixing Twitter: Improving
the Performance and Scalability of the World's Most Popular
Microblogging Site" by John Adams of Twitter's Operations group.
Twitter runs on a combination of Ruby, Java, and Scala - all on x86 and
Linux.
</p>

<p>
Another talk on my short list is "The Fast and the Fabulous: 9 Ways
Engineering and Design Come Together to Make Your Site Slow."  Check out
the full catalog at
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/full/">http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/full/</a>.
</p>
 
<p>
Presentations from Velocity 2008 are here:
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/proceedings/">http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/proceedings/</a>
</p>

<p>

(Presentation slides from June's Velocity are here:
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/proceedings/">http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/proceedings</a>)
</p>

<p>
Velocity takes place June 22-24, 2009 at The Fairmont hotel in San Jose,
CA. The Semantic Technology conference also takes place in San Jose,
but earlier (June 14th-18th). This year's SemTech is the fifth annual
event, and is one of the major events in the Semantic Tech community.
</p>

<p>
SemTech attendees will hear about the latest semantic software
advancements, from medical records management to bio-terrorism
preparedness. The most recent SemTechs had technical people from
those secretive three-letter agencies, discussing ways intelligence
reports are processed into knowledge bases. 
</p>

<p>
More signs of Semantic Tech entering the Web sphere comes from Google's
recent semantics experiment: Google introduced a beta feature that they
call "Rich Snippets", which enhances search and presentation results by
marking up pages with special microformats.
</p>

<p>
SemTech conferences insist that attendees pre-select first- and last-day
tutorials. However, on the last day, extra books from all tutorials are
put out for attendees to take. SemTech perks also include good meals
and a nice conference bag. Check out the conference Web site:
<a href="http://www.semantic-conference.com/">http://www.semantic-conference.com/</a>
</p>


<p>
JavaOne has been <em>the</em> annual Java event on the planet since its
inception back in 1994. Although attendance has been slipping gradually
since the dot-com bust, it still features many definitive talks on Java
technology and emerging industry standards. However, conferences like
Javapolis have emerged as strong regional conferences and viable
alternatives.
</p>

<p>
The main drawing card is that founders and gurus like James Gosling are
in attendance and hold court in keynote talks and panels. then there
are those great t-shirts with original artwork from Gosling, launched
out into the sea of Javaheads with sling shots and home-made mortars. 
</p>

<p>
One 2008 presentation that joined Java and Semantic Tech was "Developing
Semantic Web Applications on the Java Platform" (PAN-5532). This was a
panel moderated by Henry Story, a Semantic Web evangelist, and had as
panelists Lew Tucker, of Radar Networks and Sales Force; Jens Aasmen,
of Franz, Inc.; Brian Sletien, of Siderian; and Dean Allemang from Top
Quadrant. 
</p>

<p>
Each panelist did a short presentation, some with demos. The demo from
Lew Tucker showed off Twine, then a new Web site which translates
between Java objects and RDF tuples. He used this to list friends of Tim
Berners-Lee. Jens Aasmen showed off 
<a href="http://www.franz.com/agraph/">http://www.franz.com/agraph/</a>
with a demo that found meetings attended in a geographic area by his
friends or friends of friends (FoF). He also demoed a "circle of love"
for people who knew each other "well" and were connected via social
networking sites.
</p>

<p>
JavaOne is enhanced by the preceeding CommunityOne day, with Sun opening
its arms to the disparate communities it has been building around Java,
Solaris, and MySQL. Last year, CommunityOne registrants got to attend
a session at JaveOne 2008 for free.  
</p>

<p>
This year, CommunityOne will run for 3 days, overlapping JavaOne. Only
the first day is free, but this free pass will also get attendees into
the JavaOne "expo" and also into keynote sessions. In 2008, most
sessions were technical and most had presentations from members of the
developer community each track targeted. There was, however, a strange
Linux track, where panels from the major Linux distros discussed some
lessons they've learned, and how those may be applied to OpenSolaris.
This track ran concurrently with the OpenSolaris technical track, which
ended in a modest installfest for for 40-50 people (and included at
least one Macintosh).
</p>

<p>
Sun provided box lunches as well as T-shirts and totes to CommunityOne
attendees last year. The lines were a bit long, especially for the
T-shirts, but it was all free. (Sorry to report, there was no box
lunch in 2009, but there were more sessions.) This is certainly one of
the better free deals in the computer industry, and is worth the effort
to register, which, by the way, will also get you earlier access to the
JavaOne archives and allow you to catch the streaming keynotes.  An
all-access pass to both JavaOne and CommunityOne and the earlier classes
at Java University will set you back $3500.

<h1>Away Mission: LinuxWorld Morphs into OpenSource World</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
For years, August meant LinuxWorld in San Francisco.  This year would
have been the 13th annual LinuxWorld.  </p>

<p>
LinuxWorld is no more, having transmogrified into three overlapping
conferences: the brand new OpenSource World, the Next Generation Data
Center (NGDC) event which started in 2007, and a new CloudWorld
conference, all managed by IDG World Expo. These events will be held
over two days, August 12-13, 2009, in San Francisco at Moscone Center
West.  </p>

<p>
OpenSource World is the true descendant of LinuxWorld, since it focuses
on open source, open standards, and open architecture, as part of an
integrated IT infrastructure. The conference will present Linux and open
source ideas in a technical context, covered by industry experts.  </p>

<p>
CloudWorld is the hot topic addition, and will supposedly focus on
infrastructure and services to drive deployment of cloud computing in
the data center. That sounds a bit like the NGDC conference, which will
focus on complete end-to-end solutions for the 21st century data center,
and new technologies for those data centers. Separating the two topics
seems like a marketing ploy, since any complete discussion of the modern
data center includes both virtualization and cloud-based computing.
</p>

<p>
That being said, the energy that used to be channeled exclusively into
LinuxWorld has found new avenues and new venues. The new
conferences sponsored by the Linux Foundation come to mind - the Linux
Foundation Collaboration Summit and the Linux Plumbers Conference
- as well as many regional events that have grown over the years.  </p>

<h3>Review of LW/NGDC 2008</h3>

<p>
Last year was the second year LinuxWorld shared the convention center
with the so-called Next Generation Data Center conference. This offered
more sessions - but at different start times - and a broader set of
tracks.  In practice, it led to less crowding in most sessions. 
</p>

<p>
There also was an almost independent Mobile Linux track that had several
of its own keynote sessions.  On the last day, there was a good panel,
moderated by Raven Zachary, on "Keeping Mobile Linux Competitive", which
discussed the players and potential upstarts in the mobile world.  </p>

<p>
There also were a few community tracks, including an Ubuntu Day.  These
seemed to be moderately attended, and I don't see these featured for
upcoming 2009 conference.  </p>

<p>
However, there also was markedly less attendance at last year's LinuxWorld.
The keynotes were held in the smaller room 134, which could only hold
about 1000 attendees. The larger expo rooms in Moscone South were
unused, and the escalators were turned off, part of the time.  There was
lots of room on the Expo floor, and I also noticed that both Red Hat,
Inc. and Novell, Inc. weren't in the Expo for 2008.  </p>

<p>
The BoFs were also a bit odd, in 2008. They spanned two nights, but were
only a single hour long. So, they were all happening at the same time,
and some of the invitational social events also occurred that same hour.
</p>


<p>
These were some new features from 2008:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Software Central - a collection of software solution vendors in one
dedicated area of the exhibitor show floor.

<li>The AppZone - Easily find open source solutions and software running
on Linux consolidated  into their own feature area within LinuxWorld.

<li>The Linux Garage - A place to catch the latest and coolest gadgets
based on embedded Linux, including PDAs and hand-held computers, mobile
phones, home automation, audio/video entertainment devices, appliances,
and robots.

<li>The Linux Desktop Shootout - The Linux Desktop Shootout let
attendees test-drive and compare the top Linux-based desktops, score
usability tests, and have the chance to win a PC and distro at the Expo.

<li>Installfest For Schools - Untangle organized a massive installfest
on the show floor to donate open source (Ubuntu) computers to schools in
need. The hardware was supplied by the Alameda County Computer Resource
Center (ACCRC), which recycles discarded computers from businesses,
government and the general public. LinuxWorld attendees could join the
installfest by installing Ubuntu or Kubuntu, hacking older hardware, or
donating unwanted computers.
</ul>

<p>
There also was a great area on the floor demonstrating the use of open
source in the development of new voting systems.  This included trial
voting machine and a mock presidential election. (Obama won handily with
about 3/4 of about 800 votes cast.)  This was sponsored by the Open
Voting Consortium.  See more details here: <a
href="http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/blog/2008-aug-29/success_at_linuxworld/
">http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/blog/2008-aug-29/success_at_linuxworld/</a>
</p>

<p>
Jay Lyman of the 451 group referenced his firm's research report, "The
Rise of Community Linux", which cites the initial use of non-commercial
distros in the enterprise.  Lyman said he sees more use of Ubuntu,
CentOS, and Debian in the data center, and noted it is now possible to get
HP support for Debian. His <a
href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2008/08/11/the-community-linux-impact/">
blog entry</a> after LW08 summarizes many of his points. Here's a
quotation: </p>

<blockquote>
"What we found is that it can work both ways. Community Linux can very
often serve as entry into the open source OS and lead to broader, more
advanced use all the way up to commercial subscriptions.  At the same
time, community Linux versions (that is, for our purposes, a
community-developed, freely available Linux operating systems for the
server) also presents an appealing alternative to commercial Linux. It
can be a particularly good option when the code is identical and perhaps
more flexible, as is the case with CentOS for Red Hat, or when the Linux
distribution is getting easier to use and support, as is the case with
Ubuntu, and when hardware providers and other players are offering
commercial support for it."
</blockquote>

<p>
I was also fond of Kyle Rankin's talk on using Knoppix for system rescue
of both Linux and Windows boxes.  Kyle is the author of "Knoppix Hacks"
and "Knoppix Pocket Reference", and lays out how to use the forensic
utilities for recovering lost files, partitions, MBRs, etc.  See:  <a
href="http://greenfly.org/talks/knoppix/rescue.html">http://greenfly.org/talks/knoppix/rescue.html</a>
(These slides have a delay time, and it's faster to move a slide ahead
and then back.) </p>

<p>
Here's a link to the LW-08 keynotes and selected presentations: 
<a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/SitePage.aspx?site=10&id=b8e13a7c-ed35-47f3-bb82-37b6cf47e530">
http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/SitePage.aspx?site=10&id=b8e13a7c-ed35-47f3-bb82-37b6cf47e530
</a></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
The conference archive from 2008 is rather limited, and old links to
last year's program are redirected to this year's event.  That may be
marketing, but I certainly don't like it.  </p>

<p>
It seems the bulk of Linux enthusiasts are going elsewhere to hang out
with their community, and for education as well.  Perhaps the wave of
Linux adoptions has peaked.  Or perhaps a free Expo and free beer --
only on the last day, by the way -- is not enough to entice casual Linux
users to commute by car or train for a few hours of the latest and
greatest, not when petrol was hitting $4.20+ a gallon, and jobs were
tightening up.  We will have to see if the current economic contraction
diminishes attendance even more.  </p>

<p>
LinuxWorld was a venerable institution. May its memory live long!
</p>

<p>
Let's view OpenSource World as a new event, and judge it on its own
merits.</p>

<h1>Software Development on the Nokia Internet Tablets</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/forsberg.html">Bruce Forsberg</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>About 6 years ago, I wrote an article on <A
HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue90/forsberg.html">Software
Development for a Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 PDA</A>. Since that time, this
device has fallen out of use, and I've searched for a new device to
take its place. As with the previous project, I had several criteria: It
had to be based on Linux, portable, and work for the audio program
that I would write. I settled on Nokia's Linux-based Internet tablets.
These are Wi-Fi enabled devices (not cellular phones) that
are ideal for monitoring the Internet while you are on the go. More and
more places are offering free Internet access, now. In my area, both
Panera Bread and Burger King restaurants offer free Wi-Fi access. They
are also ideal for travel and not having to lug a heavy laptop around.
mplayer has been ported, and, if you scale down a movie, you can play it on
your Nokia Tablet on an airplane, for instance. (All devices have a kill
switch, to disable all transmissions such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.) 
Three models are currently available, either new or used; the
N770, N800, and N810. Even though the N810 is the latest device, some
people still prefer the N800.  Currently, as this article is being written,
the N800 goes for about $100 used and $150 new, and the N810 for $150
used and $225 new on eBay.  The N770 is an older device and is no longer
supported by the software developers, and thus should be avoided. It also
uses the RS-MMC memory cards, which have lower capacity then the miniSD
and microSD cards that the others support. I will give a brief overview
of the N800 and N810 devices. For more detailed hardware information, see
the Wikipedia pages for these three devices.</P>

<P>Wikipedia page for the Nokia N800:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N800">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N800</A></P>

<P>Wikipedia Page for the Nokia N810:

<P><IMG SRC="misc/forsberg/N810.png" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="330">Nokia Internet Tablet N810</P>

<P>The N800 and N810 are similar, with a few differences. The N810 has a
slide out keyboard and built-in GPS, where the N800 does not. The N800
has two memory card slots: an internal one and an external one. The N810
has one external memory slot with a built-in 2GB card. The N810 has
another nice feature that allows one to lock the touchscreen and keys, so,
when you place it in your pocket, the keys and screen do not
accidentally register a press event. The N800 has the same feature, but
requires multiple events to activate and deactivate. The N800 has a
mini-USB Type B connector, where the N810 has a micro USB connector. The same
operating system and applications work on both. The latest OS is called
OS2008, or Maemo 4.X (which is code-named Diablo). If you would like to see
the tablets in action, listed below are 2 YouTube videos that go over
the capabilities of the devices.</P>

<h3>Setup for Development</h3> 

<P>For development, there are two basic APIs available. The native API is
the GTK+ and GDK libraries, used in the GNOME desktop. But Qt 4.5,
used in the KDE desktop, has also been ported to the Maemo platform,
and is available as well as the Qt 3 compatibility library. To assist
developers with software development, there are several Web sites that
are helpful. One is a place to host new projects just for the Nokia
tablets, called <A HREF="http://garage.maemo.org">garage.maemo.org</A>.
This will allow you to have a source code repository, as well as perform
bug tracking, news items, and mailing lists, as well as other functions
needed for software development and for collaboration. Another Web site
that is useful is a wiki-based help system at <A
HREF="http://wiki.maemo.org">wiki.maemo.org</A>. When you go to this
Web site, you will find a developers section that will be very useful for
assisting you with certain tasks. For anything related to Maemo, you
would go to <A HREF="http://maemo.org">maemo.org</A>.  </P>

<P>In order to setup development, you will need to follow the steps
below. I will go over them briefly. More detailed information is
available at maemo.org. Click on the Development tab, and, when there, go
to the Documentation-&gt;Tutorials section. You should see a Diablo
reference manual available. Download this, and follow the directions.
This will go over in detail how to setup and develop for Diablo. Note,
by the time you read this article Fremantle might be the latest Stable
OS. If so, then look for a reference for Fremantle, and substitute
Fremantle for Diablo everywhere in this article. Here are the steps to
follow:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Install Scratchbox</LI>

	<LI>Install targets for X86 and ARM for Diablo in Scratchbox</LI>

	<LI>Make sure your device is updated with corresponding OS</LI>

	<LI>Outside Scratchbox, install the Xephyr X server tool. You will 
        need to search your distribution for this. This allows you to 
        open a window on your Linux box that can emulate a Nokia display.</LI>

</OL>

<P>When you first develop for this platform, you will do this on your PC
instead of the device. This is done using a piece of software called
Scratchbox. This allows you to run different Linux environments in one.
The current OS software used, as of the writing of this document, is
called Diablo. There is a new one coming called Fremantle, but it is
still in beta. You begin by installing Scratchbox on your PC.
This requires a Linux OS. Since Scratchbox is Debian-based, it installs
most easily on a Debian-based system. I personally run it on an OpenSUSE
10.3 system. The advantage to Scratchbox is that you can create targets,
such as X86 Diablo, and install software packages in this target and
this is all you will see. It provides a sterile environment from your
Linux PC. With the Diablo ARM target, you can compile packages for the
Nokia devices. It is important to note that, depending on how many targets
you install, this area can become large. My Scratchbox is over 1 GB.  To
start, you need to install the Maemo Diablo SDK on your PC. Your best bet
is to follow the detailed instructions at maemo.org. Click on the
Developer tab, and go to the SDK Releases section. As of this article
date, you would select Maemo <A
HREF="http://maemo.org/development/sdks/maemo_4-1-2_diablo">4.1.2
Diablo</A>. Read the Release notes and the INSTALL.txt documents, and
follow these directions. You will want to install both the X86 and ARMEL
targets. If you are using the Diablo 4.1.2, you will want to make sure
your device has the corresponding OS installed on it. For detailed
directions on updating your OS, go to <A
HREF=http://wiki.media/org">wiki.maemo.org</A>, and in the Users section,
there will be a document titled "Update the tablet firmware". Follow these
directions.  Last, look for Xephyr. This is most likely part of your
distribution, and is probably already installed. If not, check your media
to see if this exists, and install it.</P>

<H3>Development</H3>

<P>You are now ready to start development. You will need to login
to Scratchbox. If you installed this on a non-Debian Linux system, then
you might need to perform the following step first. In another
shell:</P>

<PRE class="code">sudo &lt;scratchbox install path&gt;/sbin/sbox_ctl start</PRE>

<P>Now, you can login. This can be done with:</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">&lt;scratchbox install path&gt;/login</PRE>

<P>Now, select the target you wish to operate in. For instance, to be in
the X86 target for Diablo, you would type:</P>

<PRE class="code">sb-conf select DIABLO_X86</PRE>

<P>You are now in an environment setup for Maemo development for the Diablo
release and for the X86 environment. You will only see header files and
libraries for this environment. The standard Debian commands will work for
adding or removing packages that you might need. You would now develop your
application just like on a normal Linux-based system. When you get your
first program to compile, you can display the program in the environment by
performing the following:</P>

<P>Start Xephyr outside Scratchbox.</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">Xephyr :2 -host-cursor -screen 800x480x16 -dpi 96 -ac -extension Composite</PRE>

<P>A window the size of the Maemo display should appear. Now, we
need to display the Maemo framework within the Xephyr window. From
scratchbox type:</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">export DISPLAY=:2 af-sb-init.sh start</PRE>

<P>You should now see the application framework displayed in the Xephyr
window. You now need to display your application in the window:</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">run-standalone.sh ./&lt;your app name&gt;</PRE>

<P>If everything has gone correctly, you should now see your application
in the application framework window. From here you can use gdb,
Valgrind, and other tools to perform your main application development.
When you get your application working well, you are ready to port it
to ARMEL, and try it on your tablet.</P>

<P>Porting to the ARMEL platform is easier than you might think. We will
use the Scratchbox environment to do most of the dirty work for us.
First, we need to switch targets:</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">sb-conf killall sb-conf select DIABLO_ARMEL</PRE>

<P>The Maemo environment is a Debian-based system. Therefore, you will
need to build your application as a Debian-type package. Once you have
this setup, you can try in on your tablet.</P>

<P>Create a binary package to try on your device:</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b -d</PRE>

<P>You can then transfer your .deb package to the tablet via the USB
connection. You will mount one of the file systems in your tablet on your
Linux PC, and transfer the .deb file. Once on the tablet, you will start
the file manager application, and locate the uploaded .deb package.  You
will double-click on it, and it will load the Application Manager
application and prompt you to install your application. If you get an error
installing your application, it is most likely a result of missing
packages. Check the dialog for any missing packages. There is also a log
menu item on the Application Manager application that you can check for
errors. You will need to install these other packages first, before it will
install yours.</P>

<P>Once you have it working on your tablet, you are ready to test the
software distribution system. Most user-developed applications go into a
repository called "extras". This is most likely where yours
will end up. There is a test play area repository called Extras-Devel.
This is what we will use first. You will need to make sure this is
enabled on your tablet. Go to the Application Manager and select the
Tools menu, and select the Application Catalog item. If there is an
Extras-Devel entry, then verify that it is enabled. If there is not one,
then create a new one. Use a name of "maemo Extras-Devel". Use 
URL "http://repository.maemo.org/extras-devel/".  Distribution
can remain blank. For Components, put in "free non-free". Make sure
Disabled is not checked. For your convenience, a link is in the resource
section of this article:  Click on it from your tablet, to 
add this repository for you.</P>

<P>You will now need to package the source for your application, from the
DIABLO_ARMEL target. In this target, enter the following to build the
source:</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -sa -S -I.svn</PRE>

<P>For the -I, use whatever the version control directories are. I was
using SVN, but you might be using another. This should have built 3
packages: a .dsc file, a .tar.gz file, and a .changes file. With these
files, we will now need to submit these packages to an autobuilder that
will build the packages in a sterile environment.  You will be emailed
back later (10 minutes or more) when it is done and whether it is
successful or not.</P>

<P>In a browser go to the 
<A HREF="https://garage.maemo.org/extras-assistant/index.php">
extras assistant</A> to submit the packages. If you have never been
approved for uploading, then you will need to create a new account first.
Follow the directions at this site. Once you are approved for uploading
then submit the source files using the Web interface.</P>

<P>Once it has compiled successfully a short time later, it will be
placed into the Extras-Devel repository. You can then remove the copy on
your tablet that you had installed by hand with the Application Manager.
Then, using the Application Manager, click Check for Updates.  Once done,
click on Browse Installable Applications. Click All, and search for your
application. Once you have found your application, install it. You
have now made available your first application to the Maemo community.
Only a limited subset of users will see your application, though, mostly
developers that have the Extra-Devel repository enabled. One of the
advantages to making your application available, this way, is that when
someone wants to download your application, it will automatically
determine what other packages are needed and download them while
downloading yours as well. The last step is to make it available to a
wider audience, by submitting it to the Extras repository. This is called
promotion. You will need to promote your application to the Extras
repository. This can be done by again going to the  <A
HREF="https://garage.maemo.org/extras-assistant/index.php">extras
assistant</A>.  On the right side, there should be a link called the
Extras Promoter Diablo. Click on the link and login. You will see a long
list of application packages. Find yours, select them, and then select
to have them promoted. This can take over a hour to accomplish, so be
patient. Wait a couple of hours, and then delete and load your
application again using the Application Manager. You should disable the
Extras-Devel repository, just to make sure. You, and everybody else,
should now be able to download the application from the Extras
repository.</P>

<P>One last optional step is to publish your new application. This can
be done at the <A HREF="http://maemo.org">maemo.org</A> Web site by
going to the Downloads section. Once there, find the Add New Application
link, and click and follow the directions for submitting this new
application.</P>

<H3>Resources</H3>

<P>There are plenty of resources to help you. By far the most useful is
the Maemo Reference Manual for what ever release you are on. In our case,
the Maemo Diablo Reference Manual. This contains step-by-step
instructions for developing on Maemo. This document explains the above
in over 500 pages, and goes into detail what I have just skimmed over.
The second most useful are the wiki pages. In the development section,
there are numerous wiki pages addressing specific issues with
development. If you are still facing a problem that you can't solve,
you can submit a question to the developers user group mailing list. You
can sign up for this at maemo.org, under the community section. Look for
the Mailing Lists link below.</P>

These are Wi-Fi enabled devices (not cellular phones) that are ideal for monitoring the Internet while you are on the go. More and more places are offering free Internet access, now. In my area, both Panera Bread and Burger King restaurants offer free Wi-Fi access. They are also ideal for travel and not having to lug a heavy laptop around. mplayer has been ported, and, if you scale down a movie, you can play it on your Nokia Tablet on an airplane, for instance. (All devices have a kill switch, to disable all transmissions such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.)  Three models are currently available, either new or used; the N770, N800, and N810.

<h1>Linux Layer 8 Puppet</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/kachold.html">Lisa Kachold</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Puppet - Easy Systems Security for Users, Developers, and
Administrators</h3>

<p>
Maintaining a large number of security checks can be daunting on a
regular basis. The problem with canned Tiger-type security log-checkers
and other daily log information provided by the system is that it's not
necessarily going to be specific to the use of that system. And, believe
me, I doubt that any user, code monkey, or systems administrator has
"reading log time" sufficiently designated based on what is available
and threatening. Therefore, the best policy is custom configuration,
except that configuring more than one system can take a great deal of
time. For this we have Puppet and configurable recipes. Once we have
our regular systems information, configured in a way we can use it, we
can spend a week or so configuring email filters via bash script/cron or
Google filters to "really alert us" when scary things happen. </p>

<p>
Little trade-offs are made in administration, development, and use, in
that we "just do the minimum" configuration since we are always running
a race against time for whatever service the Linux systems are
constricted to. This might be Twitter, YouTube, and GMail,
Eclipse/Maven, or a systems backup server. These are the kinds of
s-hexy solutions that allow one Linux administrator to maintain more
than 100 production systems (GoDaddy.com, Dotster.com, Google.com) in a
secure, cost effective, profitable way. <p/>

<p>
Did the past systems administrator build all the servers without NTP
(and used a different UTC time compared with systems time)? Puppet can
pull these strings.</p>

<p>
With your /etc/sudoers, for instance, in Linux Layer 8 Security, the
"minimum" is simply not good enough! Along comes the power of
Puppet.</p>

<h3>Puppet Packages - Production Secure?</h3> 

<p>
While Puppet does install using Ruby (and can be expanded with Ruby
Gems), it does not include any SUID binary. Therefore, Puppet fosters
little added risk in most production environments. Puppet uses OpenSSL
certificates.  Therefore, we are assured that all information is as
secure as current encryption technology.</p>

<h3>Configure Quick Solutions</h3>

<p>
Now, having the ability to implement a recipe from a single unique
server, configured once and laid on or used many times, seriously
changes the way users, developers, and administrators can work. Say, CERT
just announced a new exploit against a service running open on one of
your DMZ systems, so, rather than simply doing a command-line iptables
entry, you can lay on a completely shop standard, fully configured
instance of Shorewall 3.0.</p>

<p> 
Is your /etc/ssh/sshd_config setup correctly? Every systems
administrator knows the sheer volume of work required for a simple
change in policy, for instance, this last year as extensive ssh-based key
exploits were announced. Puppet can do this instantly across your two
home servers if you want to be able to concentrate on development work.
</p>

<p>
Key management is a huge task for all the servers or users involved;
except with Puppet.</p>

<p>
Nagios is a great tool for systems monitoring, but incredibly long to
configure across a huge network, except with Puppet.</p>

<p>
Instead of using freshclam to keep your systems running ClamAV updates,
use Puppet.</p>

<p>
How about password management? Believe it or not, many production
systems simply remove a user's VPN access, when the employment
relationship is severed. All of the users from the last 5 years (groan - or
more) of systems history are all still in the password files? So any of
their SSH -L tunnels outbound via port 80/443 from anacron/cron or
special jobs will happily continue to work. Puppet can manage
users/passwords correctly with ease.</p>

<p>
Haven't configured all your YUM repos correctly because of the sheer
task of logging into or bursting configurations and testing 30 servers?
Backups are trivial via Puppet.</p>

<p>
Did your DNS server list just get changed by the discovery of recursion
on or another Kaminsky-ish BIND exploit? No problem with Puppet; you
can change these instantly.</p>

<p>
Do you run a Linux/Solaris shop? Puppet will configure a CDE login.</p>

<p> 
And Puppet can even be configured to setup more of itself on each new
system, once you have one setup to your liking.</p>

<p>
Do you need to change the /etc/motd entries to add a security banner for
100 machines? Do you need to change an email address on index.html or
revamp your .htaccess files on a server cluster? Do you need to make a
crontab script change? Puppet will do text file editing, also. </p>

<p>
Imagine the possibilities.</p>

<p>
Puppet is new, but the concept is not; cfengine and other tools exist.
However, Puppet is clearly the simplest and most powerful for most uses
in a pure *nix environment. Expect great things, as this tool
matures.</p>

<p>
NOTE: If your systems management style is reactive, having originated
from Trenches Dot Com University or Crisis Junkie 101 courses, and/or you
are being hounded to just "Do it now, really quickly" (the insecure so-
called "profit-driven" way), your entire focus will be changed
radically. Your shop will have a great deal of time to implement
greater things, once you are pulling the strings on your systems.</p>

Therefore, the best policy is custom configuration, except that configuring more than one system can take a great deal of time. For this we have Puppet and configurable recipes. Once we have our regular systems information, configured in a way we can use it, we can spend a week or so configuring email filters via bash script/cron or Google filters to "really alert us" when scary things happen. </p> ';

<h1>GNOME and Red Hat Linux Eleven Years Ago</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/laycock.html">Oscar Laycock</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Four years ago, I switched on an old PC and found a seven year old (at
that time) copy of Linux on it. I still use parts of the 1998 Red Hat
Linux, today.  </p>

<h3>Red Hat Linux in 1998</h3>

<img src="misc/laycock/redhat.png" alt="powered by Red Hat Linux" width="107" height="58">

<p>
My copy of Red Hat Linux is 5.1, codenamed "Manhattan". It was released
on May 22, 1998. The first Red Hat Linux 1.0 was released on November 3,
1994. Finally, Red Hat Linux merged with Fedora on 22 September 2003,
when Red Hat started Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I bought an official
boxed set with a manual in the autumn of 1998, for &pound;29.95 (British
Pounds), from a mail-order catalogue. The catalogue also listed Slackware
3.5, Debian 1.3, TurboLinux 2.0, Caldera 1.2, FreeBSD 2.2.7, and BSD
Lite 4.4. Before then, I had been using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_(operating_system)">Coherent</a>,
a Unix Version 7 clone, originally produced for the PDP-11 in 1980 and
ported to the IBM PC in 1983.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/box.jpg" alt="boxed set of Red Hat 5.1" width="412" height="309">

<p>
The kernel is 2.0.34. It does not support thread-local storage, so I get
an error when I run a program built with a recent compiler.  </p>

<p>
Red Hat Linux 5.1 includes a "Linux Applications CD", a collection of
third-party programs. It has versions of 
WordPerfect<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>, Tripwire, and
several relational databases.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/wordperf.png" alt="Wordperfect" width="600" height="450">

<h3>Free software in 1998</h3>

<img src="misc/laycock/linux.png" alt="Linux logo from LDP Linux Programming Guide" width="110" height="88">

<p>
Netscape <a
href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html">released</a>
the source code of its browser and Communicator suite on March 31, 1998.
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/netscape.png" alt="Netscape Navigator" width="600" height="450">

<p>
The GNU C Library, glibc, for my Red Hat 5.1 is version 2.0.7. Red Hat
Linux 4.2, released in May 1997, was the last Red Hat Linux based on the
Linux libc "libc 5". The Linux kernel developers had forked glibc in the
early 1990's. Their last version was called libc.so.5. According to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libc6">Wikipedia</a>, "when FSF
released glibc 2.0 in 1996, it had a much more complete POSIX standards
support, better internationalisation/multilingual support, support for
IPv6, 64-bit data access, support for multithreaded applications, future
versions compatibility support, and the code was more portable. At this
point, the Linux kernel developers discontinued their fork and returned
to using FSF's glibc." The new glibc 2.x series was given the internal
name "libc.so.6".  </p>

<p>
It was the time of the EGCS fork of the GNU C compiler. EGCS stood for
"Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System". My Red Hat 5.1 includes an
early version, 1.0.2, released on March 18, 1998. But the default
compiler is gcc for stability.  GCC development followed a "cathedral"
model and had become quite conservative. In 1997, a group of developers,
some from Cygnus, formed EGCS to merge several forks, including g77
(Fortran), Pentium optimizations and many C++ improvements. According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">Wikipedia</a>,
"EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous than GCC
development, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on
their GCC 2.x compiler, 'blessed' EGCS as the official version of GCC
and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999." It
was at that time that GCC was renamed the "GNU Compiler Collection".
</p>

<p>
Red Hat 5.1 came with a 2.0.1 version of PHP/FI. Developer Rasmus
Lerdorf warned that it is "quickly going to be superseded by Version
3.0", citing "dramatic improvements".  PHP3 was released on June 19
1998. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a>
says, "Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two Israeli developers at the
Technion IIT, rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the basis of PHP 3,
changing the language's name to the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor<a href="#2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> ... Suraski and
Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend
Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan,
Israel." </p>

<p>
KDE 1.0 was released on 12 July 1998. KDE was founded in 1996. In
November 1998, Qt became open source, dual-licensed under the open QPL
and a commercial license for proprietary development.  </p>


<h3>1998 GNOME beta</h3>

<img src="misc/laycock/logo.png" alt="GNOME logo" width="150" height="46">

<p>
Red Hat 5.1 includes a preview of the GNOME desktop environment, a beta
release.  The release notes say, "It is the results of about 4 months of
feverish work by an Internet-based development team." GNOME development
was announced in August 1977. The first major GNOME release, version
1.0, was to be in March 1999.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gnome.png" alt="GNOME" width="600" height="450">

<p>
The GNOME distribution's README file says: "It is indisputable that
Linux is a rock-solid server OS, but traditionally Linux has not catered
as much to the typical desktop user, who wants to write email, browse the
web, etc. The GNOME project aims to provide a desktop environment that
will be friendly to novice users, but at the same time provide the power
and flexibility that advanced users expect." </p>

<p>
GNOME did not come with a window manager. You could just run the GNOME
panel from your .xinitrc file, as in:
</p>

<pre>
panel &amp;
background-properties --init &amp;
keyboard-properties --init &amp;
mouse-properties --init &amp;
fvwm2 -f .fvwm2rc.gnome     # disable fvwm2 taskbar
</pre>

<p>
The background, keyboard, and mouse properties programs restore your
previous settings for the background image, mouse sensitivity, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>file manager</strong> is a GNOME version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander">GNU Midnight Commander</a>, a clone of Norton Commander. Midnight Commander has a text user interface and is still <a href="http://www.midnight-commander.org/">developed</a> today. 
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gmc.png" alt="GNOME Midnight Commander" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>image viewer</strong> is Electric Eyes, developed by "The
Rasterman", Carsten Haiztler, at Red Hat Advanced Development Labs. He
worked on the Enlightenment desktop. It was one of the first
applications to use Imlib, an X-based imaging toolkit. You can crop
images, do simple color table tweaking, and resize or rotate images. It
was superseded by Eye of Gnome and GQView, neither of which had any
image manipulation features. The last release of Electric Eyes seems to
be 0.3.12 in July 2000.<a href="#3"><strong>[3]</strong></a> It last
appeared in Red Hat Linux 7.3, released in May 2002. It still appeared in
Mandriva till 2007.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/ee.png" alt="GNOME Midnight Commander" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The release notes have a section on "GNOME Tricks", "a preview of the
awesome abilities DnD will bring to your desktop". You can drag an
image from GNOME Midnight Commander or Electric Eyes, onto the panel or
the background-properties dialog, to set their respective backgrounds. You
can also drag an image from GNOME Midnight Commander onto Electric Eyes.
You can print a file by dragging it from Midnight Commander onto the
print applet in the panel.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>GIMP</strong> is on the GNOME "graphics" menu alongside
Electric Eyes. It is version 0.99.28: </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gimp.png" alt="The GIMP" width="580" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>file open dialog</strong> is much simpler than today's:
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/fileopen.png" alt="File open dialog" width="385" height="376">

<p>
A <strong>message box</strong> looks like this: </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/question.png" alt="Question dialog" width="254" height="194">

<p>
<strong>GNOME terminal</strong> does not have modern features like tabs
or transparency. It was written by Miguel de Icaza, and used code from
the Zvt terminal widget by Michael Zucchi. Today's GNOME terminal
appears to date from 2002.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/terminal.png" alt="GNOME terminal" width="600" height="480">

<p>
In the GNOME <strong>audio</strong> menu, there is the Extace Waveform
display, an audio mixer, and a CD player. On my setup, Extace says it
cannot connect to esound, and I cannot get the mixer to work at all. The
CD player does better: </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/cd.png" alt="CD player" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The GNOME applications menu includes emacs and <strong>gEdit</strong>
0.4.0, written by Alex Roberts and Evan Lawrence. It is described as a
"small and lightweight text editor for GNOME/Gtk+". You can only open,
save and print files, cut and paste, and search and replace. The options
to change the text font and toggle auto-indenting do not seem to work.
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gedit.png" alt="gEdit" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>GNOME Calendar</strong> resembles the calendar app found in
Microsoft Outlook at that time: </p>

<p>
<img src="misc/laycock/cal1.png" alt="Calendar - day view" width="600" height="480">
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/laycock/cal2.png" alt="Calendar - week view" width="600" height="480">
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/laycock/cal3.png" alt="Calendar - edit appointment" width="600" height="480">
</p>

<p>
GNOME has <strong>GTimeTracker</strong> by Eckehard Berns. You select a
project and start and stop a timer. You can run a shell command every
time you select or deselect a project. You can create a log of all your
activities.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/timetrack.png" alt="GTimeTracker" width="600" height="480">

<p>
GnomeCard, an address book application, and the Gnumeric spreadsheet had
been added by the time of Red Hat Linux 6.0, which was released in April
1999.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>GNOME system monitor program</strong> is GTop 0.20 by Radek
Doulik. In the picture below, in the background, is a coloured chart of
memory usage. You can choose to see the total, shared, or resident sizes.
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gtop.png" alt="GTop" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>system log monitor program</strong> is Logview 0.1, by Cesar
Miquel. You can choose a day on the calendar and see the relevant log
entries.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/logview.png" alt="Logview" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>GNOME Search Tool</strong> has options to specify a last
modified date range, file ownership, to use the "locate" command, to not
descend into mounted filesystems and to add extra "find" options. It
looks like you can search for specific content or apply a command.
Unfortunately, none of these options works.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/search.png" alt="Search Tool" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>GNOME Help Browser</strong> says it is "an interface to the
various forms of documentation present on your computer, and from other
computer via the Internet". It can load a GNOME help page for an
application, although "not much documentation in this format exists
currently". It will load HTML across the Web and present man and info
pages. It will do "whatis" queries, and load local files.  </p>


<img src="misc/laycock/ghelp.png" alt="GNOME Help" width="412" height="309">

<img src="misc/laycock/ghelp2.png" alt="GNOME Help" width="600" height="450">

<p>
The <strong>games</strong> included are a solitaire card game,
minesweeper, mahjongg, and the "same game". Inspiration for the "same
game" came from the KDE game.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/freecell.png" alt="solitaire" width="600" height="498">

<img src="misc/laycock/mines.png" alt="minesweeper" width="216" height="234">

<img src="misc/laycock/same.png" alt="same game" width="300" height="222">

<p>
GXSNMP is a basic SNMP <strong>network management</strong> application.
Unfortunately, I do not have a network!  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/snmp.png" alt="SNMP application" width="600" height="619">

<p>
On the GNOME system menu are various <strong>properties</strong> screens:
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/background.png" alt="Background properties" width="504" height="474">
<img src="misc/laycock/screensaver.png" alt="Screensaver properties" width="504" height="474">
<img src="misc/laycock/bell.png" alt="Bell properties" width="504" height="308">
<img src="misc/laycock/keyboard.png" alt="Keyboard properties" width="504" height="349">
<img src="misc/laycock/mouse.png" alt="Mouse properties" width="504" height="239">
<img src="misc/laycock/lookfeel.png" alt="Look and feel properties" width="504" height="176">

<p>
There are two menu options to run a command. They lead to the
<strong>"grun"</strong> program, which shows a simple dialog with an input
box, which runs the typed command in my root xterm. It does not seem to
do anything else.  </p>

<p>
There is also yagIRC, "Yet Another GTK+ based IRC client" and GHex, a
binary file editor. The browser is Netscape Navigator.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>panel applets</strong> include Wanda the Fish, ready with a
fortune cookie. There are CD player and audio mixer applets. I do not
appear to have a mixer, so it is not shown.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/wandaapps.png" alt="Wanda and CD player panel applets" width="211" height="52">

<p>
There are four "monitor" applets available in the panel, showing battery
usage, CPU load, disk/memory usage, and disk usage: </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/monitorapps.png" alt="Monitor panel applets" width="372" height="52">

<p>
The "network" applets comprise: a PPP dialer, a mailcheck, modem lights,
network load monitor and a "Web control" to launch Netscape Navigator.
(The network load applet says it needs IP accounting turned on in the
kernel, to work.) </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/networkapps.png" alt="Network panel applets" width="440" height="52">

<p>
There are several "utility" applets for the panel, including a clock, a
clock and mailcheck together, a floppy drive mounter, and the
drag-and-drop printer applet. There is also a workspace pager (not
shown), which says it needs a window manager with the XA_ extensions. I
am using "twm", which is probably not sufficient.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/utilityapps.png" alt="Utility panel applets" width="283" height="52">

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
From switching on, I can get to the 1998 GNOME desktop in two to three
seconds, whereas with a recent kernel and KDE it takes thirty. I like
the simplicity. The programs do most of what I want.  </p>

<p> [1] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  That would
be Corel WordPerfect 8.0 Download Personal Edition, which was really
an extraordinary product: a stable, fast, polished, full-featured
word processor running in about 6 MB of RAM, compiled from the fabled
WordPerfect Corporation portable C version that they originated
on NeXTStep.  It's still a credible Linux option to this day (if
barely), which is amazing - although the problem of retrofitting needed
support libs is onto modern Linux distributions, by now, daunting and 
can only get worse.
</p>

<p>
It's poignant to consider how much better Corel might be doing if they'd
stuck with quality portable C code, rather than dallying first with a
buggy and resource-grabbing Java rewrite, and then with yet another
ground-up rewrite in C++ / Microsoft Foundation Classes, which in turn
forced them to abandon all OS platforms other than Win32.  
</p>

<p>Fans of the 1990s WordPerfect for Linux 8.x series can get
information including the fix for the Filtrix bug, language packs, and 
other useful resources via my 
<a href="http://en.tldp.org/FAQ/WordPerfect-Linux-FAQ/">WordPerfect for
Linux FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
The version of Tripwire you mention was "Tripwire Academic Source
Release (ASR)", a no-charge for non-commercial usage licence.  About a
year later (October 2000), Tripwire, Inc. converted the product over to
GPL (with a proprietary variant also available with additional features
and support).

<p> [2] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  In the grand
open source tradition of Slightly Dopey Initial Project Names They'd
Rather We No Longer Remember, Rasmus's language and related code were
originally called "Personal Home Page".  (See also "Kool Desktop
Environment".)
</p>

<a name="3"></a>
<p> [3] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  I hear that
the show-stopper with Electric Eyes was Imlib's limitations:  Rendering
and scaling were primitive and memory-management faulty, and it was
missing too many needed features.  Eye of GNOME was based on gdk-pixbuf, a 
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/feature/archive/gdkpixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.html">specific
replacement</a>.

<h1>Encryption with TrueCrypt</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/maiorano.html">Ariel Maiorano</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>About TrueCrypt</h3>

<p>
From its <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org">Web site</a>, we learn that
TrueCrypt is free, open-source disk encryption software for Windows
Vista/XP, Mac OS X, and Linux.  Its more common use would be to create
a virtual encrypted disk within a file (called a volume file), and
mount it as a real disk. Anyhow, it also implements mechanisms to
provide plausible deniability, a hidden volume inside another one, and,
of course, the possibility to encrypt an entire partition or storage
device. Operating system encryption is supported only on Windows at the
moment.  </p>

<p>
Encryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly), and transparent.
Regarding this "on-the-fly" property of the way TrueCrypt works, we read in
the official documentation: </p>


<blockquote>
On-the-fly encryption means that data is automatically encrypted or
decrypted right before it is loaded or saved, without any user
intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read
(decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct
encryption keys. The entire file system is encrypted (e.g., file names,
folder names, contents of every file, free space, metadata, etc).
</blockquote>


<p>
Although more popular on Windows operating systems <a
href="#ref2">[1]</a>, TrueCrypt runs well on Linux, and its volume files
are fully cross-platform. General <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/">documentation</a> about how to use
the program is mainly focused on the graphical user interface of the
Windows version, but information about how it works, encryption
algorithms, hash algorithms, technical details, etc. is very complete,
and applies also to the Linux version.  </p>


<h3>License conflicts</h3>

<p>
As already mentioned, from the official documentation, we know that
TrueCrypt is free and open-source software. However, despite several
user requests, it has not been included in most popular Linux
distributions and repositories, because of some concerns regarding
TrueCrypt's collective license.<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>
Major Linux distributors consider it non-free; in this <a
href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/distributions/2008-October/000276.html">post</a>,
for example, from a Red Hat representative, it's explained why they
think that, even if Fedora complies with all of the conditions and/or
obligations imposed by this license, they still would not be protected
from a lawsuit from TrueCrypt. For the Fedora official position
regarding this issue, you should check this  <a
href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ForbiddenItems#TrueCrypt">link</a>,
and, for Ubuntu, this  <a
href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/109701">one</a>.  </p>

<p>
Anyhow, if you plan to redistribute TrueCrypt, or software based on it,
you should probably get some legal help. That being said, you can of
course, download the full source code tree and use it as best suits your
needs in a private way.  </p>

<h3>The algorithms</h3>

<p>
TrueCrypt implements three symmetric block encryption algorithms (also
called ciphers, so there are block ciphers, symmetric key ciphers,
etc.): AES (for Advanced Encryption Standard), Twofish, and Serpent. The
program also can combine the use of ciphers, so, when selecting the
algorithm to use, you'll see options like Serpent-AES or Twofish-Serpent.
The cryptographic hash functions implemented and available in TrueCrypt
are RIPEMD-160, SHA-512, and Whirlpool.  </p>

<p>
If this does not sound familiar to you, know that a block cipher
operates on chunks of data of a fixed length, each one of them is a
block. AES, for example, uses blocks 128 bits long. These blocks consist
of your input: what you want to cipher, usually plaintext. When a cipher
encrypts a block of plaintext, it outputs a transformed block of the
same length, and that's called a block of ciphertext. This is done using
the key, as another input for the cipher process, which also has to be
of a fixed length (up to 256 bits long in Twofish, for example).  </p>

<p>
Another aspect to take into consideration is that an extra step may be
necessary if you are going to encrypt some plaintext larger than the
block cipher block size. In these cases, the implementation chooses (this
being not part of the algorithm itself) a "mode" of operation.  The
ciphertext block of the previously encrypted block of plaintext may be
combined with the actual plaintext block you are going to encrypt. The
mode in which you use an algorithm determines how block processing would
be chained, if processing is to be done at all. For the first block,
when using a chaining mode, of course you don't have any previous
output, so you use what's called an initialization vector (IV), usually
made of random data, that you would make as public as the other
resulting ciphertext blocks.  </p>

<p>
The key is not the array of ASCII characters that forms your password -
not in recent cryptographic implementations, at least - but the output of
a cryptographic hash function applied to that password and a salt.  </p>

<p>
Cryptographic hash functions can take a block of data of arbitrary size
and return a fixed-size output block (128 bits long, for example, for
MD5). This output is called the hash value, and sometimes it's referred
to as the message digest - the message being the input, or simply the
digest. Any change in the input would produce a substantially different
hash value.  </p>

<p>
The salt is a random number generated as part of the input for the hash
function, usually simply concatenated to the password, so that the same
password does not generate the same hash value. It's as public as the
resulting hash, as you'll always need both values to do password
comparison. This way it's harder to dictionary-attack a password.  </p>

<p>
There are standards specifying that the hash function should be
applied repeatedly - a minimum of 1000 iterations is recommended in the
RSA PKCS5 <a
href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2127">standard</a>
- each time hashing the output or hash of the previous iteration, to
finally produce the key bytes to be used as the input key for a
symmetric cipher.  </p>

<p>
Regarding general cryptographic theory, you could check out the online
version of the book <em><a
href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">Handbook of Applied
Cryptography</a></em>.  A very brief and basic description of every
algorithm follows, but for further reference and a more in-depth
discussion of each one, please refer to the references, and as to how
they're implemented in TrueCrypt, to the program's <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=technical-details">technical
documentation</a>. Also, remember that block ciphers may be used in
different modes of operation. These modes determine the way to chain (or
not) outputs from ciphering each individual block of plaintext, when
this input is larger than the block size. Recent versions of TrueCrypt
use the XTS <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=modes-of-operation">mode</a>
(IEEE 1619 standard).  </p>

<ul>
<li>Symmetric ciphers available in TrueCrypt:

   <ul>
   <li><a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/">AES</a>: Advanced
   Encryption Standard. It was originally published as Rijndael (1998), a
   word derived from the authors names: Joan Daemen and Vincent
   Rijmen. This algorithm was the selected (2001) one in the NIST's AES
   contest, and so the standard specifies it as a FIPS-approved
   (FIPS-197) one that may be used by U.S. Government organizations (and
   others) to protect sensitive information. It has a 128-bit block size,
   with key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.  Rijndael supports other
   block and key sizes, but the former were the only ones selected for the
   AES.  It's worth noting that it has been analyzed extensively and is
   used worldwide.<a href="#2"><strong>[2]</strong> </li>

   <li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html">Serpent</a>:
   The algorithm was a finalist in the AES contest, and ended up in second
   place, right after Rijndael. Authors are: Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and
   Lars Knudsen. Implements a block size of 128 bits long. Its key size
   may be 128, 192, or 256 bits long. First published in 1998.</li>

   <li><a href="http://www.schneier.com/twofish.html">Twofish</a>:
   Another finalist in the AES contest. Authored by: Bruce Schneier, John
   Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson. It
   has a 128-bit block size, and a variable-length key size: a minimum of
   8 bits, a maximum of 256 bits, being a multiple of 8 bits. Also
   published in 1998.</li>
   </ul>

<li>Cryptographic hash functions available:

   <ul>
   <li><a href="http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html">RIPEMD-160</a>:
   The name stands for RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message
   Digest. Authors are: Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart
   Preneel. It produces a 160-bit-long hash value, but there are other
   versions of the algorithm, as well (RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256, and
   RIPEMD-320). It was first published in 1996.</li>

   <li><a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2withchangenotice.pdf">SHA-512</a>:
   SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. This one belongs to the the
   SHA-2 family. These functions were designed by the NSA, and published by
   the NIST as a U.S. FIPS, in 2001. As you may already guessed, SHA-512
   generates a 512-bit-long hash.</li>

   <li><a href="http://www.larc.usp.br/~pbarreto/WhirlpoolPage.html">Whirlpool</a>:
   From one of Rijndael authors, Vincent Rijmen, and Paulo
   S. L. M. Barreto. Published in 2000.  It produces a 512-bit-long hash
   value.</li>
   </ul>

</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
We are going to build and install the latest version of TrueCrypt from
source (latest version being 6.2a at the time of this writing, released
June 15, 2009). You could also download .deb and .rpm packages, for
Ubuntu and OpenSUSE respectively, from TrueCrypt's Web site. Of course,
you could go that way if you have one of the two supported Linux
distributions. If not, or if you're running one of these but prefer
compiling the software you will use on your own system, you should
download the source code for Linux/MacOS, and continue reading this
installation section. Note: the .zip package of the source code does not
contain the same files; if you encounter a Microsoft Visual Studio
solution file (.sln) instead of a Makefile, you have downloaded the
Windows version.  </p>

<p>
The documentation tells us that our system should meet the following
requirements for building the software: </p>


<ul>
<li>GNU Make</li>

<li>GNU C++ Compiler 4.0 or compatible</li>

<li>pkg-config</li>

<li>wxWidgets 2.8 shared library and header files installed or
  wxWidgets 2.8 library source code (available at <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">http://www.wxwidgets.org</a>)</li>

<li>FUSE library and header files (available at <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">http://fuse.sourceforge.net</a>
  and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse">http://code.google.com/p/macfuse</a>)</li>

<li>RSA Security Inc. PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface (Cryptoki) 2.20
  header files (available at <a href="ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20">ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20</a>)
  located in a standard include path, or in a directory defined by the
  environment variable 'PKCS11_INC'.</li>
</ul>


<p> 
Depending on your Linux distribution, you may already meet most of
these requirements.  (Surely not all of them in default Linux
installations, I'm afraid.) You should, of course, install from
distribution packages or source, as you prefer. The components you'll less
likely have are FUSE and the RSA header files. Also, wxWidgets, if you
didn't need it before. Some quick hints and notes before the step-by-step
installation procedure: </p>

<ol>
<li>If you download FUSE distribution packages, remember to download the
"fuse" or "libfuse" and "libfuse-devel" packages for your
distribution.</li>

<li>Also consider that you'll need kernel sources if you are compiling
FUSE; the package name in most distributions is named
"kernel-devel"</li>

<li>The main RSA header file (pkcs11.h) includes source code comments
indicating that some code should be uncommented before use; don't do
that, because there's no need. The file Common/SecurityToken.h in
TrueCrypt's source has all the #define lines needed.</li>

<li>If you'll build a NOGUI version of TrueCrypt (that is, the NO
Graphical User Interface executable), as we are going to be doing in
this "by example" article, note you still should download the wxWidgets
library source code. However, installing them is not necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Step-by-step installation instructions follow. The only assumption
made is that the files "TrueCrypt 6.2a Source.tar.gz" and
"wxX11-2.8.10.tar.gz" have been placed in the /tmp directory.
TrueCrypt's Web site does not seem to provide a public direct link for
download, and the wx libraries' source code is hosted on Sourceforge, so
you should download those files with your Web browser. PKCS #11 include
files will be downloaded with the wget command. Finally, not all
commands need root access, but, in the examples, I've logged in as root.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@w2 ~]# 
[root@w2 ~]# cd /tmp
[root@w2 tmp]# mkdir pkcs11
[root@w2 tmp]# cd pkcs11
[root@w2 pkcs11]# wget ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20/pkcs11.h
[root@w2 pkcs11]# wget ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20/pkcs11f.h
[root@w2 pkcs11]# wget ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20/pkcs11t.h
[root@w2 pkcs11]# cd ..
[root@w2 tmp]# tar xvfz wxX11-2.8.10.tar.gz
[root@w2 tmp]# tar xvfz "TrueCrypt 6.2a Source.tar.gz"
[root@w2 tmp]# cd truecrypt-6.2a-source/
[root@w2 truecrypt-6.2a-source]# export PKCS11_INC=/tmp/pkcs11
[root@w2 truecrypt-6.2a-source]# make NOGUI=1 WX_ROOT=/tmp/wxX11-2.8.10 wxbuild
[root@w2 truecrypt-6.2a-source]# make NOGUI=1 WXSTATIC=1
[root@w2 truecrypt-6.2a-source]# cd Main
[root@w2 Main]# ./truecrypt --test
[root@w2 Main]# cp truecrypt /usr/local/bin/
</pre>

<p>
Note: after executing truecrypt with the --test option, you should see
<code>Self-tests of all algorithms passed</code>. The TrueCrypt compiled
binary is copied to a system directory manually, because the Makefile
does not provide an "install" target.<a href="#3"><strong>[3]</strong></a>
</p>

<h3>Before you begin...</h3>

<p>
Now, again according to the documentation, some requirements should be
met by our Linux system for running TrueCrypt: </p>


<ul>
<li>Kernel, including FUSE, device mapper, and encryption modules</li>

<li>FUSE library (available at <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">http://fuse.sourceforge.net</a>)</li>

<li>device mapper tools (available at <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/dm">http://sources.redhat.com/dm</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>

As mentioned before, you may already have most of this software in your
"modern" Linux distribution installation. Also, FUSE for example should
have been installed for the compiling process. Take into account also that
recent Linux kernels already include FUSE. If your system lacks some
component, follow the links described in the official documentation, or
search the Internet for the corresponding packages for your distribution.
</p>

<p>
When done, check that the FUSE kernel module loads; if that goes well,
you should be OK.  </p>

<pre class="code">
[root@w2 tmp]# modprobe fuse
</pre>


<h3>Command-line options</h3>

<p>
The official documentation regarding command-line <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=command-line-usage">options</a>
applies only to the Windows version of TrueCrypt. So, before going on
with a couple of examples on using this software, I'll copy and paste
here the output of what the documentation tells us to do, if we want to
know how to execute TrueCrypt and are on Linux or MacOS; that is, use
the "-h" option. Also, this is a fairly good way of getting an idea of
what a program can do.  </p>

<p>
Option details and some simple usage examples are also printed, following
this list of command-line options. I'll include in the
following section a couple of standard examples, but with their output,
so you can see exactly how it works.  </p>

<h3>Encrypting</h3>

<p>
Now, we are going to create example volume files, and mount them. These
are the files that are encrypted and decrypted "on the fly" when
mounted. You can think of them as read/write .iso files, for example, but
you won't be using the mount command; you'll use the TrueCrypt binary,
instead. When you work inside the mounted "partition", encryption (and
decryption, of course) takes place automatically.  </p>

<p>
The first thing we are doing, then, is to create a 5 MB standard volume
file. Note we're using the "-t" option, which stands for "Use text user
interface", and the "-c" one, for "Create new volume". This way, we will
be asked for all the information needed to create the volume. We could,
as expected, use other command-line options to determine some of this
information, but I think it's clearer in this manner.  </p>

The use of <a

may add an important security enhancement to the process: It will be
combined with the password in encryption and decryption. Just for
testing, we will use a compressed file; the documentation recommends
this kind of file (mp3, for example) and also randomly generated ones.
You may think of it as a private key. You can of course use a public
available file, but that's the secret you should only share with people
with whom you also share the password. It will serve as a sort of source
of random data.  </p>

<h3>Finally</h3>

<p>
As you could see from the examples, TrueCrypt's command-line mode is not
complicated at all. It's a powerful tool to rapidly secure files using
strong cryptography and easily move them around. (The volume file may be
copied to a pen drive, and then be mounted on a Windows system, for
example.) It runs on Linux, it's well documented, it's free, and you
have access to its source code.  From a cryptographic point of view,
the implementation of robust, modern, and well known algorithms, the
lifetime of the program, and its popularity, may give you some
confidence.  </p>

<p>[2] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:
This testing is one of the best arguments for AES/Rijndael, and the
reasons why are worth elaborating on.  Elsewhere in software, it's often
assumed that newer algorithms are better, so new ciphers ought, in
general, to be more trustworthy.  In cryptography, though, it's the
other way around.  New ciphers, however impressive their specifications
and design might be, are treated warily in favour of well-tested 
alternatives, the older the better.  Thus, in the competition that
led to the selection of Rijndael as the Advanced Encryption Standard,
Bruce Schneier's Twofish algorithm seemed, superficially, to have the 
edge on his earlier Blowfish cipher -- but, in fact, Blowfish is
more-trusted of the two, as it's withstood much more, more varied, and
more protracted attacks by expert cryptographers, without breaking.

<p>[3] <span class="editorial">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer comments</span>:
It is a good practice to download, uncompress, and compile everything with a
different user than root. You need root privileges only for installing
the software. On every system, I have a build user that prepares
everything; root only installs it. Be aware that most Makefiles and
configure scripts consist of code that runs on your machine. Nobody's
perfect, and, if these scripts fail, the damage will be less if you use a
dedicated build user account with no privileges.</p>

<h1>Real World Cases For Apache's mod_rewrite</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
Technology is a funny thing; sometimes you want to write about a
specific part of it. Sometimes, you want to share your knowledge with
someone, but to do it, and do it well, you feel the need to explain
all the other technologies used to make that one specific part
successful.
</p>

<p>
This article is not really about understanding
how <code>mod_rewrite</code> works. If it were I'd probably need to
write about things like: the
HTTP <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">protocol</a>,
the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> HTTP
Server, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular
Expressions</a>, and a few others.
</p>

<p>
One doesn't need to know about how a car works, from the principles of
physics all the way up to its mechanics, to be able to drive one,
right? Therefore, this article isn't going to touch on what's under
the hood when dealing with <code>mod_rewrite</code>. Instead it will just show you
how to turn it on, and get on the road with it.
</p>

<p>
So, what's <code>mod_rewrite</code> good for? It's a quick, yet fairly
flexible and potentially complex way to manipulate URLs on the server
side using regular expressions rules. You can match HTTP requests on
several different criteria like server variables, HTTP headers, and
others.  </p>

<p>
I am not sure about other Linux distributions, but, on Fedora, my
distribution of choice, the Apache HTTP Server is installed out of the
box with <code>mod_rewrite</code> loaded, but disabled.
</p>

<p>
To enable it just add:
</p>

<pre>
RewriteEngine On
</pre>

<p>
to your httpd.conf, or if you are running several Virtual Hosts on your
server, you can enable <code>mod_rewrite</code> per Virtual Host.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you've worked with regular expressions, and you are not very
comfortable with them, it's very easy to become overwhelmed by them. To
make things a bit easier, <code>mod_rewrite</code> has built-in logging
to help the administrator debug the rules.  
</p>

<p>
To enable your <code>mod_rewrite</code> logging:
</p>

<pre>
RewriteLog /var/log/httpd/rewrite.log
RewriteLogLevel 5
</pre>

<p>
At least, this way you will start working with Apache rewrites ready 
to debug them.
</p>

<h3>Four Real World Examples:</h3>

<p>
1. The company you work for sends out some marketing publications, and
someone realizes that the URL printed on the cover of the document was
wrong. It was supposed to have been:
<code>http://www.yourcompany.com/ask_me_how/</code>, but instead was printed as
<code>http://www.yourcompany.com/ask-me-how/</code>. This is probably the most
basic and classic example of <code>mod_rewrite</code>: given a URL, redirect the
user to another. Here's how to fix it:
</p>

<pre>
RewriteRule ^/ask-me-how/$ /ask_me_how/ [R,L]
</pre>


2. Your company's Web site has two
domains: <code>www.yourcompany.com</code>
and <code>www.yourcompany.net</code>. Your boss notices while
searching on Google that the results are treated as two different
sites. He wants you to find out
a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google_Webmaster_Help/web/faqs-for-crawling-indexing-and-ranking-2?pli=1">way</a>
to tell Google that both domains should be treated as one site.

<p>
On your Apache config, enable <code>mod_rewrite</code>, and redirect your traffic
using Permanent Redirect HTTP code 301. By default, <code>mod_rewrite</code>
redirects are 302 (Temporary Redirects), and Google search would still
index the domains as two different entities.
</p>

<pre>
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yourcompany.net$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.yourcompany.net$
RewriteRule ^.*$ http://www.yourcompany.com/$1 [R=301,L]
</pre>


<p>
3. Suppose you have a Web site supporting both standard and secure
connections (a.k.a. HTTP and https), and your boss requires you,
without much notice (if any) to force all http:// traffic to be
directed to https://. Well, if you are running Apache and have
<code>mod_rewrite</code> enabled, all you need is the following rule:
</p>

<pre>
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L,NE]
</pre>

<p>
4. Imagine a situation where, for one reason or another, you want to
block links made from another site to your site. Maybe an unauthorized
site found an exploit on your application and made a link available
for people to download some copyrighted material. You could use
<code>mod_rewrite</code> to block any request coming from that site by matching the
HTTP_REFERER of the incoming request. Although this isn't the final
solution, as I would hope your company would take the time to close
such an exploit, this could come in handy as a quick emergency
solution.
</p>

<pre>
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} http://www.hackersite.net [NC]
RewriteRule - [F]
</pre>

<h3>Syntax Overview:</h3>

<p>
RewriteCond - is a directive that allows you to test a certain
condition for a rule to be applied. Think of it as your everyday
programming language if-statement. Two or more RewriteCond can be
written sequentially as a logical AND, or by adding a [OR] at the end
of the line for a logical [OR]. You will notice that RewriteCond is
pretty flexible and allows you to write tests for server variables
like HTTP headers, Connection and Request, Server Internals, and even
System Information.
</p>

<p>
RewriteRule - is the most important directive you will be using. It's as
the Apache documentation calls it, the 'real rewriting workhorse' of the
<code>mod_rewrite</code> module. It usually takes 3 parameters: pattern
to match, string to substitute, and a list of flags. Here's a list of
flags I've used on the examples above: 
</p>

<p>
<code>R</code> - tells RewriteRule that you are doing a redirect, and,
unless you pass the code 301, it will default to a 302, which means
moved temporarily.
</p>

<p>
<code>L</code> - tells RewriteRule to exit the chain of rules and not
follow anything else after the last RewriteRule.
</p>

<p>
<code>NC</code> - make the pattern to match case insensitive.
</p>

<p>
<code>NE</code> - tells RewriteRule not to escape the resulting URI
with things like %20 for a blank space.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Apache's <code>mod_rewrite</code> is an incredibly flexible tool allowing a
System Administrator to act quickly to solve issues with a Web
server. Some fixes may be of a temporary nature until a proper
permanent solution is put in place, and, even though there will be
times where <code>mod_rewrite</code> may be part of permanent solution, don't get
too used to them, as <code>mod_rewrite</code> rules can pile up fast and become
quite hard to maintain. Have you ever had to maintain Perl code with
regexes everywhere? If so, you probably know what I am talking about.</p>

<p>
Finally, if you want know more of what's under the hood of <code>mod_rewrite</code>,
make sure you read Apache's <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html">documentation</a>, and, when in doubt use
<code>mod_rewrite</code> logging to help you debug your rules.</p>

<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?

<p>
Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
Last night, we went to a little Indian restaurant here in Charleston;
the owner had put on some music that was lots of fun, a sort of an
Indian hip-hop with a little Hinglish rap thrown in, a fast beat and
very dancy. When I tried to ask him what it was, or who it was by, or
even where I could get a CD, he told me that it was "just some Punjabi
music" that he had put together on a tape, and he didn't seem willing to
give up any more details (artist, style, etc.) I've done some cursory
looking around on Youtube, and haven't found what I'm looking for,
although here's some stuff that's similar:
</p>

<p>
# "Gaddi", by Jazzy Bains: kinda close, but a bit too repetitive
<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjkz4-Zwz2o'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjkz4-Zwz2o</a>
</p>

<p>
# "Mundian To Bach Ke", too rap-like, not enough singing
<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gef48exMfo'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gef48exMfo</a>
</p>

<p>
It doesn't seem to be Bhangra (although I may be wrong, all the Youtube
hits for 'bhangra rap' or 'bhangra hip-hop' are turning up... well, I
don't have the musical vocabulary to describe it, but not the right
thing, anyway.) Any suggestions on what to look for? I know we have a
lot of Indian readers, so I thought this might be a good place to ask.

...Alexandra Tomoe (巴) - the newest Okopnik. Born aboard S/V Ulysses
at 12:17pm on 7/21/2009, she seems to have good lungs and a fine
appetite - which is a good start in this boisterous family.

<pre>
&gt; I agree that this particular episode does take the cake!

<p>
It goes on ... a video about reading text with pagers like "more"
and "less". (Since I did not actually look at the video --- w3m! ---
I am not sure whether "most" was covered or not.)

Perhaps this is all part of an elaborate joke of some kind!

<h1>The Backpage</h1>

<p> 
I sometimes wonder if all of life isn't a test; some sort of a game in
which we get a pat and handshake - once we've left the building - and a
hearty "well played, old fellow!" if we've given it our best. Wild guesses
and our common human need to imagine immortality for ourselves aside
(not that it's not a great conversation, but it would take a few bottles of
vodka, Russian-style, and at least a night or two to puzzle it all out), it
would all begin to Make Sense - as if life is supposed to do anything that
pedestrian.
</p>

<p>
To bring it all back down to earth, I'm talking about the fact that
meaningful events - call them "troubles", or call them "peak experiences",
or what have you - rarely come alone; usually, they show up as an entire
kit'o'stuff, and we poor humans have to bear up as best we can. The last
few months, for example, have been full of noise and trouble and craziness
and glory: there have been many upheavals here at LG, when we didn't know
whether it would live or die (the question is still somewhat pertinent, and
much depends on whether we get more people involved and <a
href="../131/lg_backpage.html">participating in the process</a>); my wife
and I took off cruising on our sailboat, something we'd been planning on
for several years; while in the midst of all this, we (just!) had a baby -
and the city of Charleston, South Carolina <a
href="http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2009/jul/25/baby_girl_born_aboard_boat90414/">
made much of the new arrival</a> since she was born right aboard our boat
in a marina owned by the city... it's been an amazing time, but I'm more
than ready for things to slow down, just a little. I really, really am.
There's such a thing as <em>wild fun</em>, and then there's completely bughouse
stark raving mad crazy insane - and lately, I've found myself tapping the
dial of the indicator to make sure that it's not stuck in the latter
position far too often. If anyone has a spare bit of Zen attitude, please
send me an email with that as an attachment...
</p>

<p>
As regards LG-related matters, we're proud to welcome our new volunteers,
writers, and columnists. <a href="../authors/bukoskey.html">Dan
Bukoskey</a> and <a href="../authors/biswas.html">Srijon Biswas</a> have
joined our proofreading and editorial staff; <a
href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a> has been cranking out some
great tech material; <a href="../authors/kachold.html">Lisa Kachold</a> has
been doing stellar work with her security-related columns; and <a
href="../authors/trbovich.html">Pete Trbovich</a> joins our humor list with
his terrifically funny "Doomed to Obscurity" cartoons. Thank you, one and
all, for your great contributions to the Linux community!
</p>

<p>
In any case, it's late, and I'm off to seek my bed. I need my rest - there
are probably more adventures coming!

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a> and <a href="okopnik1.html">son</a>;
his Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation
points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
