<P>    Dear sir:
       
<P>       I realy got some troubles with Samba and need your help. After
   read every associated docs in the Samba documents and SMB-HOWTO,
   problem is there yet.
<P>       I'm trying to interconnect Win98 with Linux. My Linux is Redhat
   5.2 with the Samba version 1.9.18p10. My Samba is started as deamons,
   that is, usind "smbd -D" and "nmbd -D".
<P>       After I set "encrypt = yes",  I can use "smbclient -L WIN98PC" to
   access the Win98's share directories. But although I can see Linux PC,
   I cann't access Linux from the Win98, no matter set "security = user"
   or "security = share". When I do that, always got a "invilad
   password". So does using "net view" and "net use" command under DOS
   prompt. By the way, I had use "smbpasswd" to generate smbpasswd for
   each smb user.
<P>       While I can login Linux with smbclient on the Linux PC itself. So
   do on the Win98 PC's Linux system(My Win98 PC is dual bootable). I use
   the RPM to remove the Samba and install again, nothing changed.Then
   What can I do?
<P>       Here is the <A HREF="misc/mail/jiang.txt">smb.conf</A> file.

<BR>Subject: Pentium-II Xeon and calculation speed


<P> Hi guys,
here I'm trying to get a little bit of help with my computer.
I'm doing a very time expensive calculations using FORTRAN programs,
compiled with g77 under Red Hat 6.1. First, on dual Pentium-II/400MHz
and Pentium-III/450MHz computers I noticed, that when program size
(RSS in top) is getting biger that approximately 600K computation speed
dramatically decreasing by factor two. This slowing down agrees with
the bus speed (100MHz) and L2 cache (512K, 200MHz). So, I've decided
that the reason lies in the cache sped/size and bought (pretty cheap)
dual Pentium-II/450MHz Xeon computer with 2MB L2 cache per proccessor
that suppose to run at 450MHz and 512M SDRAM on SuperMicro mainboard.
Unfortunately I did not find any difference in performance of this
computer and still much cheaper dual Pentium-II/400MHz. Why is it?
May be, Red Nat 6.1 somehow must be told explicitely about cache size?
But I did not find any such option...

<P> Hi !

<P> I am not quite familiar with Linux installation and stuck at this point.

<P> I have a new DELL with 13 GB hard-disk running windows98 second edition.

<P> I bought Partition Magic 5.0 to create couple logical drives and Linux

<P> I am trying to install RedHat 5.2 using a bootable disk and a CD -ROM.

<P> For some reason, neither disk-druid nor fdisk (in-built) recognizes my
Logical Partitions.

/hda1 &lt;size&gt; Win95 FAT 32
/hda2 &lt;size = 13 GB - size of C drive&gt; 0x0f  (blank in type field)
</PRE>

<P> That means, the installation process does not know there are couple of
Logical Drives and  also a Linux Native and a Swap Partitons. What does
0x0f type means ?

<P> fdisk however shows there are partitions on MS-DOS propmt but
installation program can not recognize them !

<BR>Subject: ? about "logrotate" on RedHat 5.2...

<P> Hi there!
I'm a linux newbie, and I'm hoping that you'll be able to answer my 
questions, as I'm kind of lost.

<P> We're currently running RedHat 5.2 on our server, and are using Apache as 
our webserver program.  We've got about 30 or so websites running off the 
same machine, each with it's own Apache webserver.  Our reasons for doing 
so is to prevent 1 website from taking out all of the rest if that 
particular process dies.

<P> Since each website has it's own Apache server running, each site has it's 
own access_log file.  Anyhow, a few of the websites have proven to be more 
popular than we thought they would be, and are generating about 1 Gb of 
logfiles every 7 days or so.  Considering that we only have 9.1 gB of hard 
disk space, we've decided that it would probably be a smart idea to start 
rotating the logfiles each week.

<P> I've been looking at the logrotate program that's included with RedHat 
Linux, and I'm a bit confused as to how it operates, and was hoping that 
you could tell me if what I'm thinking will work.

<P> In the file /etc/logrotate.d/apache it lists
<PRE>
#/var/log/httpd/access_log {
#    postrotate
#       /usr/bin/killall -HUP httpsd
#    endscript
#}
</PRE>

<P> As what I'm guessing the default logrotation would be.

<P> Since my configuration has the access_log files located at
<PRE>
/logs/account1/access_log
/logs/account2/access_log
/logs/account3/access_log
/logs/account4/access_log
....
/logs/accountX/access_log
</PRE>

<P> I'm going to guess that I need to change
<PRE>
/var/log/httpd/access_log
</PRE>
to
<PRE>
/logs/accountX/access_log for each accountX
</PRE>

<P> Here's the crux of my problem though - the section that states
<PRE>
#    postrotate
#       /usr/bin/killall -HUP httpsd
#    endscript
</PRE>

<P> is worrying me because I dont want to send multiple /usr/bin/killall -HUP 
httpsd signals over and over again if it's not neccessary.

<P> Can I put the /usr/bin/killall -HUP httpsd command in the 
/etc/cron.daily/logrotate file so that instead of
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
</PRE>

<P> it instead says
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
/usr/bin/killall -HUP httpsd
</PRE>

<P> and have the /etc/logrotate.d/apache file read:

<PRE>
/logs/account1/access_log {
}
/logs/account2/access_log {
}
/logs/account3/access_log {
}
/logs/account4/access_log {
}
/logs/accountX/access_log {
}
</PRE>

<P> for each accountX that I have?

<P> Thanks for any assistance that you can give....

<BR>Subject: Question on motherboard support

<P> Hello,
Some time ago I upgraded my machine from 486-33Mhz to PIII 500Mhz.
I bought a PC-Chips M741LMRT motherboard which has on-board VGA,
sound and modem.  Linux installed ok on it and is really fast
(boots up in less than 20 seconds!!), but X windows configuration
is crashing when trying to detect the on-board VGA (I belive it's
a SiS 5595 chipset).  I am only getting 320x200 mode.  When I
amended the config file manually to get an 800x600 true-color mode,
X loads, paints the background and hangs up.  Anyone has used
such motherboards?  Or are there any patches for this motherboard?
Regards

<BR>Subject: help

<P> sir,
I need some help.

<P> Question1,

<P> I wrote a <A HREF="misc/mail/huang.c.txt">program</A> of showing the contents
of other program on the platform of LINUX,the compiler is g++, but got problems
in statement 1 and statement 2.

<P> First,I want to show the sentence in statement 1 
ahead of the body of file being showed,but it can't
appear in the proper position.I mean I want the
program running like this:

<PRE>
This is the body of file
    FILE BODY...
This is the body of file
    FILE BODY...
    </PRE>

<P> but it running like this:

<PRE>
    FILE BODY...
    FILE BODY...
This is the body of file
This is the body of file
</PRE>

<P> I don't why,how can it be corrected.
Second,I had believed the statement 2 is illegal in
grammar.Because if you define an array, char
buffer[BufferSize] ,the BufferSize indicate the number
of elements in array and should be a constant or at
least be a const variable,and it can't be a variable,
otherwise the program cann't be compiled. But the fact
is this program is compiled smoothly and functions
normally. What is wrong? 


<P> Question 2,
I write a <A HREF="misc/mail/huang2.c.txt">c program</A>.

<P> But when compiling, gcc reports that all the functions
with "vga_" profix are  undefined,what is the problem?
I had included "vga.h" in my programe as indicated in
"man" help on the usage of either "vga_" function.

<P> My name is Chris Hennessey and I am currently a first year law student at Franklin Pierce Law Center located in Concord, NH.  Franklin Pierce is a law school renowned for its intellectual property program and it strives to educate students entering fields in the forefront of technology.  I have been elected as a class representative for the Licensing Executive Society and have a strong interest in the field of software licensing.  I am particularly interested in the "copy-left" movement in the software industry and I know that Linux is at the forefront. 

<P> I am currently trying to help organize this Franklin Pierce's annual Licensing Symposium which will be held on Saturday, March 25.   I would very much like to have a Red Hat or Linux based representative come and speak at the symposium about what is going on in the world of freeware and shareware or other general software licensing issues.  

<P> As the Editor of the Linux Gazette, I am certain that you could help me.  Perhaps you are interested or know of a Red Hat attorney or anyone who be interested in speaking at this event.  The Licensing Executive Society is a global organization and this would be an opportunity to speak to law students from around the world about Linux. 

<P> I would really appreciate any assistance you may be able to provide for me, please contact me via email.  

<P> Thank you.

<BR>Subject: 2 quick questions

<P> I have two quick questions...

<P> One concerns my modem.  When i dial into my isp, my modem hangs up after
connect every first time i try.
so, it always takes exactly two tries to get going.  What could my modem
be NOT doing the first time that it ALWAYS figures out how to do the
second time?

<P> second, I would like to ask for a QUALITY set of general instructions on
how to install things i download off the internet such as realplayer 5
for Linux which comes in rpm form.  I have downloaded various programs
from the  net in rpm form, only to find very sloppy instructions on
setting things up.  In the case of realplayer in particular, I get a
message (using rpm at the command line with the -i switch) that says
realplayer is installed.  But where does it get installed to? i can
never find it... i type the executable command and get another message
that core is been dumped.  This is after having to copy the rpm into the
/var/lib/rpm directory just so the rpm util can find things it needs to
install my package in the first place.

<P> hey, sorry, i just thought of question #3:
I KNOW i created 3 swap partitions, but only one is enabled. (hda7) what
are the names of my other partitons? i have altogether 4 partitions: one
root and 3 swap.  so hda1 is root and hda 7 is one of the swaps, but
what is the convention for nameing devices to partitions? i tried to
enable my best guesses (hda 5 and hda6) in linuxconf as additional swap
partitons, but with no luck. how do i find them and how do i enable
them? thanks.

<P> I run redhat 6.1 with Gnome as my desktop on a amd 350 with 128 megs of
ram, but i dont have any preference to desktops, so instructions to fit
any of them will be greatly appreciated.

<P> Please understand that i am working on almost six years of experience
with computers and am not afraid to try new things.  I am new to linux;
however, I am not afraid to follow technical instructions, as long as
they are accurate.

<P> I have two PCs on my lan - an NT4sp6 box and a RHLinux6.1 box.  They share a
UPS.  The UPS has hardware and software which will allow it to send a
shut-down command to just ONE box.  That box then has to send a shutdown
command to the other.  I know how to do this if they were both running NT
(there is a command in the NT resource kit to allow you to send a remote
shutdown).  But I have NO idea how to do this from one OS to the other.  Any
ideas?

<BR>Subject: Postscript or HTML editions of Gazette

<P> I've read the FAQ on Gazette distributions.

<P> I would like read the Gazette either as HTML or PDF format.

<P> The FAQ talked about being able to use the "Print to file" option of Netscape
to produce a postscript version of the Gazette which Acrobat viewers would be
able to read (I assume).

<P> I've tried exporting the front page of the Gazette to a postscript file which
netscape the extension PRN onto.
I've tried renaming the extension to PDF to see if the Acrobat viewer would
take the file.   It didn't.

<P> If I can't use Acrobat to view the Gazette, I'm fine using HTML format if I
can get the pages downloaded onto my local PC to view them offline.   Apart
from using a web page archiving program, how else would I be able to view the
Gazette offline?

<BR>Subject: SuSE reseller not playing fair in Uruguay

<P> From comp.os.linux.announce:

<P> <A HREF="http://www.linuxstart.com/~rodolfo/openletter.html">
http://www.linuxstart.com/~rodolfo/openletter.html</A>



<P>   These pages are a open letter to the Linux Community signed by a
group of users to show the problems that they are living with the name
LINUX in Uruguay.


<P>  Uruguayan SuSE reseller wish to obtain exclusive rights on the
LINUX name

<P>  With No. 316.081 of  August 30, 1999 has been filed before the
Uruguayan Trademark Office a trademark application for registration of
the LINUX name to International class 42 (computer related services).
This application has been filed by Mr. Francisco Pereira and Mr.
Enrique  Place de Cuadro, addressed at 1207 Pedro Berro Street, Esc.
603, of  Montevideo, Uruguay.  In accordance with the official
publication from the Industrial Property Bulletin No. 6 of December
1999. 
   Mr. Pereira and Place are part of the firm called LinuxTECH who is
the reseller of the SuSE Linux distribution for Uruguay. 
  This is a improper proceeding by somebody to obtain exclusive rights
over the LINUX name through the known way to register the trademark in
the own name. 
   Since Mr. Pereira and Mr. Place have started their activity in
Uruguay with LinuxTECH company they have not stopped to looking for
seize exclusive commercialization of Linux in Uruguay: 
                                       

<P>  Firstly, they obtain the exclusive representation to sell SuSE
distribution, with which they prevented that anybody can import SuSE
Linux, as several people of the Uruguayan community came doing. This
has been resisted by some users who, by means of protest, have
obtained that German SuSE send the new distritutions directly to them.
  Immediately they created its own company calling with a copy of the
wellknown Suisse company LINUXTECH. Of course, they also filed their
own trademark application LINUXTECH under No. 316.082 saying thath the
name LINUXTECH is of their own property. 
   Into their commercial name they do not doubt to place the word
LINUX (LinuxTECH). Without any doubt the use of the world LINUX  in
the commercial name allows they to rise to the prestige that enjoys
LINUX in the market, taking advantage of the freedom that enjoys LINUX
for its generalized use. (Nobody would be happend to  initiate a
computer company called MicrosofTECH of  WindowsTECH, seeing that
without doubts it would have legal troubles). 
 Afterwards, they register under the .uy DNS the domain
www.linux.com.uy, being  in the  knowledge that the Uruguay Linux User
Group have and use the domain www.linux.org.uy since 1997. With this
action Mr. Pereira and Mr. Place want to "capture"  the unprepared
internaut who looking to accede to the UYLUG site falls in their
pages. 
 Finally, they try to make official the deffinitive apropriation of
the LINUX name appling the registration in their behalf. 

<P>   The Uruguay Linux User Group -UYLUG- through representatives of
their Board of Directors has tried to dialog  with Mr. Pereira and
Place to obtain at least the withdrawal to their improper application
of registration but without any doubt, it is facing people which use
aggressive commercial tactics and do not know the opening principles,
cooperation and solidarity that exist into  the Linux community. 

<P>   From already the Uruguay Linux User Group will take ahead all the
legal and out-legal actions to obtain these two people do not see made
the LINUX  name total control.

<P>        Montevideo, January 6,2000

<BR>Subject: To The Editor

<P> Dear Editor,

<P> I recently wrote an article, The Penguin and Me, which appeared in the
January Issue of Linux Gazette. I am thrilled at the response from your
dedicated readers, but feel I must reply publicly to some misconceptions
on my part that proved to be incorrect.

<P> First and formost I must make clear that my experiences, although very
limited, are with the Linux-Mandrake 6.0 distro only. I have no
experience with or personal knowledge of any other Linux distribution.

<P> Linux-Mandrake, 6.0 is compiled for Pentium machines. It will not run
under 386 or 486 machines. However, early versions of Mandrake such as
5.3 which was optimized for the Pentium processor should run very well.
Thanks to Civileme, of the Mandrake "Expert" group, I now understand
that other distributions may vary, and, many of them are compatible with
the 386 and 486 processors.

<P> Linux does not support all dual processor motherboards. However, all
motherboards should support dual-boot systems.

<P> I apologize for any inconvenience my comments may have caused. 

<P> Thank you for the opportunity to apolgize to the Linux community, to the
gentle readers who have generously given their time to comment, and to
the publisher of Linux Gazette.
