<h3>The Foolish Things People Do With Other People's Computers</h3>

<blockquote><em>
[A friend, who wishes to remain anonymous (case is due in court), sent this]
</em></blockquote>

<p> Well I now have an even stranger story to tell you all.  It involves 5 under
cover cops and me standing at a <em>[train]</em> station at 01:15 this morning.  

<p> The story begins  some time between 15:30 and 18:00 yesterday.  Someone
broke into the house I am staying in. and stole a bunch of stuff including
my laptop and passport.

<p> That was that and the last I thought that I would see of those, but then
the burglar in their ultimate wisdom decided to ring my mother from the
number on my passport -- he was willing to return the items for a "finders
fee"  

<p> I decided to let the cops in on this information and arrange to meet with
him. So I was standing at a <em>[train]</em> station with 5 under cover cops somewhere
around and this very wise burglar turned up (in his car!) to return the laptop.
When he offered to sell it back the cops moved in and arrested him.  

<p>Quite mad!

<h3>Releasing the Mouse</h3>

<p>
<strong>[dups]</strong>
Had to share this with the TAGsters... I have some new found respect for
the abilities of my trusty linux box.  Yesterday I came across a mouse
that seemed to have made his home in my apartment. A super quick little
blighter that was seen darting between hiding spots. I contemplated
trying to catch the offending rodent, but his acceleration made him
untouchable  so I made a note to get hold of a trap from the store and
lure the thing to its demise with a piece of cheese. That was not
necessary however... the next time the rodent was sighted he was making
a dash along the wall and ended it with a hop into my linux box which
was on the floor with the side panel open. heh. the panel was quickly
replaced, cables detached and then my 2.6.8 kernel went along for a walk
to deposit the trespasser in the canyon outside my place. (although i
think this particular trick may work with windoze as well)

gotten a replacement...

Thomas leave a bottle of <a

You're welcome, Brian. It's something we felt deserved to be continued,

making it drier, but then it gets a little too chewy and hard to

I'm sure by now you've heard about the woman who walked into a bar and
asked the bartender for a double entendre... so he gave it to her.

<p>
Of course, an accidental double entendre (a.k.a. a Freudian slip), is
when you say one thing but you mean your mother.

Hurricane Ivan is on the way (I've always <u>said</u> them damn Russians are

Show me a pair of dark sunglasses, and I'll show you a member of the 
Russian mafia.  Extortion: what apparatchiks do under Capitalism. 
Oh wait, they did the same thing under Communism too.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Soft mud plus a steel
boat - shouldn't be too much trouble, but - again - I'm reserving
judgement until I get there. Note that both of these places are known
for <u>not</u> getting hit: St. Augustine, in particular, has had a total of
four hurricanes pass over it since 1906.
<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Do you want me to ask the Weather Service to redirect the storm so it
hits St Augustine and the "Ulysses" but nothing else?

As if I haven't had enough crap to contend with this month... my mail
redirector, ben@<em>[domain name dot org]</em>, has suddenly died (it still accepts the
mail - just doesn't forward it.) I've filed a ticket with the folks that
host it, but meanwhile I've got two days worth of mail that's hanging in
limbo.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Well, of course it had to happen. You told everyone but yourself to save

<p>

I guess that's why my customized overhead high-pressure zone went away,

Well, I haven't quite mastered twisting people's arms via email - the

<h3>The Horror...</h3>

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
I wanted a photo off my parent's digital camera. They have Windows ME.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Jason, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. How could you do that to
your poor parents? There I was, thinking of you as a <u>responsible</u> sort
of geek, and you let those poor innocents be <b>abused</b> by that horrible
creature from Redmond!

<p>
(Say, perhaps we should make a horror movie.)

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Voice over: It was the time of twilight, a time of mortal men and a time
of immortal evil. A time when the young offered the aged in bloody
sacrifice.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Right... let's see, who could we get to do Vincent Price's voice for
this? I mean, we need <u>creepy</u> here. Hmm, wonder if John Ashcroft is
available.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Who could star? Wonder how much Christopher Lee charges?

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
<b>sob</b> I'm sorry! I didn't know better at the time!

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
There, there. At least now you know how to make the boo-boo awwww
bettah. :)

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Windows was hanging on me

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Yes, it'll do that. I've found that a good prybar is usually sufficient
to break the grip, after which that same implement can be used to
threaten the monster until it realizes the futility of its endeavor and
shambles off in search of other, more innocent victims.

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Wait...a greater quanity of innocent victims, or victims not as guilty
as me? :)

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Were you looking for any answer other than "yes"? :)
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Ben, we're making a movie here. It's not a "monster", it's a "fell
beast, rent from its evil age, when... etc".

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Uh-huh, "rent from its evil age". How much rent are we talking about,
here? (And what's an "evil age", anyway? Late teens to early twenties,
or what?) Sheesh, trust an Irishman to slip in an old political issue
when no one's looking...

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
CUT! Script check!

<p>
"The fell beast, torn from aeons past, when evil wore the blackened sky
as a cloak."

<p>
Better?

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
No, I'm thinking more along the lines of a reality TV show: "Big
Brother XP"

<p>
Watch as millions of people from across the country volunteer to live
with the Windows operating system in a desprate attempt to get work
done. See the anger: "What...illegal operation!? I NEED THIS REPORT
NOW!". See the deception: "Okay, the box says it works with my version
of Windows, and I installed the drivers right, so why doesn't it..."
Watch as secret alliances are formed: "I want to uninstall IE...what do
you mean, it's part of the OS?". Feel the betrayal: "What, 50 uses and
then I need to 'register'? But...my computer crashed, and when I tried
to register after I reinstalled, it didn't work! I <b>PAID</b> for this
software!"

<p>
You can watch "Big Brother XP" 24/7 anywhere Windows runs. (Or rather,
anywhere Windows doesn't run in a very specific way.)

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
The subtle, unobvious effects are the worst ones... but I suppose we
could provide an MP3 of some creepy music to at least hint at it.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Seriously, at the time they purchased the computer, ME had just come
out, so I thought "hey, why not". I now know why not, and wish I had
just told them to go with 98SE, which is not supposed to be as bad.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Say, didja hear about the latest version of Wind0ws? It combines the
three most popular versions and is named after them: CE/ME/NT. Once it's
in your computer, it sets solid and can never be removed...

Nah. Though it should have had an apostrophe (as it was founded by John

Great Ghu, Jeanne and Karl having sheered off (at least according to the
NOAA predictions), but remains of Ivan; they were calling for 35-40
knots by tonight through tomorrow afternoon, but have now changed that
to 20-25kt from tonight (and that is about what we've got at the moment)

I like the story of how the residents blew up their own castle, rather

I've always assumed that the family surname was from Denmark on account

One of these days, I'll get some Norwegian or Dane to sit down with me

Woolworth's was already in decline when I was born so I never saw one in

60s, a place that had small non-food items for a dime (supposedly).

<p>
In Tacoma there's a Piggly Wiggly that may be the last of its kind in
the west.  Kind of like a dime store anachronism.  Although I hear
Piggly Wiggly used to be a big grocery chain back east.  Tacoma is
kind of the place chain stores go to die.  There's a Frisco Freeze
(like Dairy Queen) and I think there's an A&amp;W.  There's also the
Java Jive, a run-down bar that's shaped like a tea kettle.

When I was in Bristol the people in the hostel recommended a cheap
supermarket, so off I went for provisions.  It was a half hour walk
away.  It turned out to be the German company Aldi, if I remember right,
which I've also encountered in Germany.  It's not a supermarket as I
think of it because they don't seem to sell large portions of anything,
so you don't get the economy of size.  I don't mean the large wholesale
sizes but the medium sizes you find at Safeway (US) and Sainsbury's
(England).  (Which, by the way, I could not find at all in Germany,
although maybe I wasn't looking in the right places.)

<!-- ::::::: m7 -->
<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
That's not a supermarket. :)  A supermarket is a large store that sells
food in family-sized portions, competes mainly on price (although Whole
Foods specializes in organics and natural foods), and tries to stock
every conceivable type of food.  It contrasts with the small mom-n-pop
grocery stores that have almost entirely disappeared.

<!-- :::::::: m8 -->
<blockquote>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Not to be confused with the current "convenience stores"/"mini marts".
The old grocery stores had fresh vegetables, meat, and milk.
The convenience stores are mostly candy and cigarettes.  Some
convenience stores that's <b>all</b> they have.  At better convenience
stores you can find a sandwich, apple, and milk, and nowadays even
a premade salad, but you're lucky if you can find an egg, and don't
even think of shopping for whole vegetables there, there aren't any.
</blockquote>

<!-- :::::::: t4 -->
<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Yes, I agree entirely with that. What you call "mom-n-pop", I'd classify as a
"corner shop" - usually family run, and stocks up on the basics such as
bread/milk, and often sells many tinned foods.

<!-- ::::::::: m9 -->
<p>

They <b>are</b> called corner shops in places that actually have them on

Although recently I
read that the kebab shops are about to disappear because the Pakistani
kids don't want to work in them, and the Anglo kids don't have
sufficient Eastern culinary skills to produce the food correctly and,
er, language skills to communicate with the owners.  The owners are
pushing the government for an emergency set of short-term visas like the
H1-B program in the US, but the government is balking because it's
preoccupied with terrorism and is not in a visa-handing mood.  The
owners are so desparate they are paying the government $100 per head
for visa applications which are then denied.  The mind boggles,
especially since it's an awful lot of money for a job that pays so
little.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Any place that sells a variety of food I would call a "grocery", whether
large or small.  But a dedicated meat/fish store or vegetable/fruit
store I wouldn't call a grocery; I guess because you can't obtain a
complete meal from them.

<!-- :::::::: t4 -->
<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
To me, a grocery store was one that predominently sells fruit and vegetables
-- and they're very hard to come buy now. So I suppose the term is now being
used here to describe the corner shops, above.

Supermarkets usually have small non-food items like utinsels, paper,
and cough syrup, but I've never seen one selling microwaves or
clothing.  Safeway did sell a small line of TVs twenty years ago, but
not now.

Supermarkets are often paired with drug stores, which were originally
pharmacies but also sell small non-food household stuff: school
supplies, kitchen supplies, razors, walkmans and cameras, and Halloween
costumes.  Boots in England is a drug store.  (Why does it have a name
like Boots if it's not a shoe shop?)  I think you call drug stores
something else in England but I can't remember the word.

<blockquote><em>[Chemists]</em></blockquote>

<!-- :::::::: t4 -->
<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Pharmacies are strictly for medications, although they too are getting rarer
and rarer as stores such as Boots take over (they have subsidery firms:
Boots-pharmacy, etc.). As to why it is called Boots - I believe it to be the
surname of the founder. They're an old company and back then, it was
tradition.

things (tables, beds, stoves and refrigerators, bathroom cabinets),
wedding and crystal stuff, etc.  Sears also sells mechanics' tools.
Nordstrom's is also considered a department store, although it only
sells clothing (mid-level and high-end).

Then there's the big stores like Fred Meyer, Target, Wal-Mart, and
K-Mart that don't really have a name.  They aren't department stores
because they aren't posh enough, but they're not drug stores either
because they have a wider selection of small non-food stuff, and they
often have lots of clothing and TVs too.  Nowadays they've come under
the generic classification of "big-box stores".  A few of them have
entire supermarkets inside them.

Then there's wholesale clubs like Costco and Sam's Club.  Costco started
in the late 80s, and were originally meant to sell to small businesses
rather than individuals, but you could also get a membership if you
worked for the government or belonged to certain credit unions
(=non-commercial banks).  But families with children quickly realized
that wholesale sizes were perfect for them and fanagled a membership any
way they could.  Then the explosion of credit-union membership brought a
ton of new members indirectly.  I don't know why Costco continues its
facade of membership restrictions and being "mainly a small-business
supplier", but they do.  <!-- Sam's Club is owned by Wal-Mart, but it's

What I mean is, Aldi seemed more like a huge convenience store, and
while it did have things like yogurt and bread it was all small portions at
convenience-store prices.  I didn't expect to find Safeway and Sainsbury's
per se in Germany, but I would expect that German families would have
something to say about having to buy convenience-store portions for a
family of four week after week, unless there are in fact some supermarkets
somewhere that I didn't see.

As it happens, I read quite a lot about especially Aldi. Every German
computer magazine has to explain every now and again, why Aldi in the
northern part of Germany often has different pc's and other hardware on
offer, than the Aldi in the southern part.

<p>
Aldi was started in the German city of Essen, in 1913, by the father of
the current owners. In 1960, the Albrecht brothers decided to split
Germany in two halves, north and south (Aldi Nord and Aldi Sued), and
each of them would only be allowed to have stores in their own part.

<p>
They split the rest of the world too, btw. Aldi in Belgium, Denmark,
France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain are owned by Aldi Nord, while
those in Australia, Austria, Great Britain, Ireland and the USA are
owned by Aldi Sued. (Yes, I had to look up the exact way they split it)

<p>
Lidl started as Lidl & Schwarz, and is a much newer company (they first
started in the seventies, in Ludwigshafen, also in Germany) and is owned
by the Schwarz-group.

tradition of skimping on workers' pay, being hostile to unions, etc.

Really? How is it they can be so cruel?

Money talks - and when money says to the mayor of Buttwipe, Nebraska "we
want an exclusion/exception/easement on the following local laws, or
we'll take this store and its 2,000 jobs elsewhere", money gets its way.
Conversely, "Governor, we're planning on giving $500,000 to your
favorite charity. Sure, it's a tax write-off for us, but we still get to
decide <u>which</u> charity! By the way, you <u>were</u> going to vote our way on
the upcoming bond moratorium, yes?" is even more effective; a stable of
tame politicians, particularly at the higher levels, can do wonders for
a large business.

<p>
Oh, and the above examples are fairly crude ones. It would still happen
exactly the same way, but the wording would be such that it could never
be construed as bribery or coercion - despite the fact that it is.

... and his favorite charity no doubt is his campaign fund ... or his

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Not necessarily - a lot of charity money comes from these sorts of deals. 
Government types like to associate themselves with charities, because it 
earns them brownie points with voters. The more their charity gets from 
their involvement, the better their reputation looks.

<p>
It's also a great way for the rich to network - companies with cash to 
spare might not need a friendly senator now, but they know they probably 
will at some stage; a senator might not need to know where to find a large 
sum of money now, etc.

<p>
It's all based in the simple psychology behind making friends; if you act 
in a friendly way towards someone, they will think favourably of you. 
Where you or I might buy someone a drink or take them to dinner in order 
to get to know someone, the mega rich throw a large sum of money at that 
person's favourite charity - it's the same gesture, but translated in 
terms of bank balance.

Oh yeah. In my area, a developer is planning to build a "mega-mall"
seems to get quite a lot of cooperation from the city council/county
commissioners/etc. A large percentage of "letters to the editor" seem to
to go something like this:

<dl>
<dt>Proponent:</dt>      <dd>You can stop growth! And think of how great this will be
                for the economy!</dd>
<dt>Opponent:</dt>       <dd>This is the last best place! Growth for the sake of
                growth is the ethos of the cancer cell!</dd>
<dt>Proponent:</dt>      <dd>That's not a fair comparision at all! It's people like
                you that hold back this area!</dd>
<dt>Opponent:</dt>       <dd>I didn't move here so I could shop in big-box stores!
                And let me tell you something...</dd>
</dl>


<p> ...and so on. I personally don't care very much, I just wish the "powers
that be" would start thinking right now about the horrible
infrastructure problems that will crop up in five years. Gee, you mean
if this mall goes in the traffic problem's gonna get <b>worse</b>?
Whodathunkit?

<!-- :::::::: m11 -->

The reason people are so uniquely enraged at <em>[supermarket]</em> is that its
famous low prices are borne by the employees to an extent not seen at
other stores.   Low wages, no benefits, "off the clock" work,
part-time positions, etc.

Then why do people work there?

<!-- :::::::::: j11 -->
<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
I can answer this one, as I am working in a place with conditions not far 
removed.

<p> For those who either are unskilled, lack documentation of these skills, 
and/or have not got the self-marketing ability to sell their skills to 
employers, there are few options available when it comes to jobs.

<p>Using myself as an example, I dropped out of college because I had chosen 
the wrong course, and couldn't afford to return. I took the first job that 
came my way, as a web designer, but soon got loaded down with other tasks I 
simply wasn't being paid for. I quit that job, got "unemployment assistance" 
(£37/week - roughly $50), quickly built up debt, and had to take the job I'm 
currently in, where I'm earning enough to pay my child support payments, but 
not enough to set aside money to make a break from where I am.

<p>One of my friends from college, the second most gifted programmer I ever 
met (and that's because chance found me sharing a taxi with rms the first 
time he gave a talk in Ireland), currently stacks shelves in a supermarket. 
(Just to illustrate, in his third year in college, while trying to write a 
game, he wrote his own windowing system.)

<p> I know plenty of people who didn't even get the chance to screw up in 
the ways I did, and who had no other choice but to accept these sorts of 
jobs.

GRRRR! What is this, the bad luck season?

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
(This is going to take a while to type)

<p>I changed shifts 4 weeks ago, so my brother and I would be able to
start a band. After 3 years without an accident, I've had 2 cuts and a
fall since then. On my third day, I picked up a knife, thinking it was
one of the half-blunt knives we use, only to find (when it was stuck
halfway into my knuckle) that it was one of those used in the beef
area. Although <em>[person]</em> is supposed to be a trained first aider,
he just stuck a plaster on it, and taped it down when the blood washed
it off, thereby making it worse. In hindsight, I should have demanded
to be taken to the hospital, but instead trusted that he would do the
right thing. It healed before I could make it to a doctor, and I no
longer have feeling in that knuckle.

<blockquote><em>[Potentially libelous statement removed]</em></blockquote>

<p>Today, I had to dispose of the hoop blade we use. We have been told
constantly that we have to throw these into the skip. This is, it
turns out, wrong in so many ways, but as it left my hand, it snagged
on my jacket, and cut through my finger, I think to the bone (I didn't
ask, because I didnt want to be sure - I was keeping a positive
outlook, but just barely). The only thing that's worrying me now is
the thought that I might lose feeling in my finger too.

<p>So... the job hunt is on with a vengeance.

<p>At least I have my heavy metal cred (Tony Iommi, guitarist of Black
Sabbath, lost two fingertips in a factory accident the day before the
band were due to go on their first European tour. On his fretting hand
- ouch!)

<h3>Wacko Topic: College</h3>

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
I'm 17, and will graduate from high school next spring. I think I'm
interesting in a job in programming (or software engineering, or
whatever they call it.) but I'm really trying to avoid going to collage,
unless there's some practical way I could do it without going into debt.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Unfortunately, I don't think you're going to get much of a choice. The world
is increasingly operating around pieces of paper. You could be God's gift to
programming, but unless you have the piece of paper to say you have done XYZ
you're not likely going to be considered.

<p>
I'm at University (is that what you call College over there?) and am doing
Software Engineering. I love programming, always have. There's a bias on this
course that is Java. Why? Because currently that's what is the industry
"favourite". I won't be doing any C (or C++) since it is considered too
"difficult". So what I have taken to doing in my assignments, is to put the
Ruby equivalent of code and show the lectureres the difference -- outlining
key features that prove a point.

<p>
Why? Well, I do not like the fact that there is a bias. I realise that they
need a language to suppliment the "theory" of Object-Orientedness, but Java?
It's slow, bloated and this nonsense of WORA "Write Once Run Anywhere" is a
myth. What it actually means is: "Write once, watch it run on Solaris and some
Linux systems, and debug everywhere else".

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Well, there's the big difference. In Ireland, fees are paid by the
government; there are at least two grants, which cover rent, for those
with lower incomes; and anyone over 21 who has been collecting social
welfare payments for at least 6 months can go to college, with fees
paid, a full grant, full weekly social welfare payments plus rent
allowance, which is roughly 2/3 of the average rent price, and an annual
book grant.

<p>
Now, even with that, I'm surrounded by people who couldn't afford college.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
And plus I need to see how I do with large projects. Most of the coding
I've done is just small stuff that I hacked together because I needed
that tool. So I'm trying to hack up a tetris clone in C using SDL (about
375 LOC, working okay, color scheme and keys hardcoded, two player
support is an UGLY kludge, but I feel pretty good about it) in order
to determine if I could work on larger programs. The jury is still out
on that.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
You shouldn't look at it like that, Jason. <u>If</u> you ever find yourself working
on a project that is large you'll only ever work on a small subset of it. You
might never even know what it is you're working on overall. You'll normally
work as a team, and get given a small task to do.

<p>
If you do take a Software Engineering course, I'll tell you that if you think
it is all about 'coding' then think again. It's not like that anymore, where
people sat up till some uneartly hour in a dark room lit only by a monitor.
What you'll find is a most invaluable role as a software engineer is program
design -- actually designing how the program works (UML essentially). You'll
probably never end up writing the raw code. Finding a job that does is going
to take you a very long time, and <b>if</b> you do, it won't be that well paid.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Well, you have to learn to walk before you run. Small projects can
become large projects if you keep at them.

<p>
Basically, it takes 2-4 years to become good at something, 2-4 to become
great, and roughly 10 to become a master.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
I don't care very much which language I'm using. It would be great if I
could use a "fun language" like Ruby or Python, (or maybe even Lisp, if
I could wrap my mind around it.) but it looks like you have to go with

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
One of my units is on AI, using prolog and lisp. Lisp is an excellent
language. Logical and useful. Just ignore EMACS. :) The language you'll use
means nothing unless you have the transferable skills behind it, such as OO,
etc. After that, all that really should remain when you switch between
languages is syntactical issues and idiosyncrasies.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
"what's cool" at the moment. It looks like Java used to be cool. Now it
looks like C#/.NET is the cool language, the one that everybody wants to
use, just because it's new and it's from Microsoft. At least it has
garbage collection.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Don't believe the hype.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Learn the "fun" language, and at least one "work" language. Smart
employers will still look for Java or whatnot, but knowing Python or
Ruby (or Perl, or Lisp, or ...) screams "I <b>like</b> programming".

<p>
I wouldn't rush to follow fashion here. C# is basically Java with all
the features they haven't gotten around to adding to Java yet. If you
know Java, you can get the gist of C# in a few hours.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
And that's why I'm writing this tetris clone in C: C isn't the most
popular language around, but it's a whole lot more popular than Ruby. It

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
No? Where did you think that? C is used <u>extensively</u> in industry, and
popularity is propoganda. Ruby is certainly used a lot, more than you think in
industry.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
seems to me as if I should learn as many marketable languages as I can,
and C seems simple and scary, whereas C++ seems complex and scary.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Heh. Keep at it.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
C++ looks complex and scary when you take a distant look at it, but if
you take it in stages, it's not as bad. Look at it as a better C first -
use function overloading, and default values. Then add classes, then
constructors/destructors, then virtual classes, then operator
overloading, then templates. It starts to make sense after a while :)

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
So, if you were me, wanting to get that kind of a job, what would you do?

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I understand that the College system works differently over there, and that
you have to finance yourself? If you can or, indeed, do, get the option of
going to college, please take it. As I said, it's paper these employers want.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Or, if you have an Irish grandparent, you can get Irish citizenship,
move here for a while, bum off our social welfare system, and get a free
education. :)

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I hope this helps.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Well, as it happens... I'm learning Java servlets and JSP, because
that's where 9/10 jobs are. I'm learning C++ because it <b>is</b> scary, and
looking at C# because the niftiest desktop software for GNOME is being
written in it.

<p>
I'm also looking at C, just because I want to learn how to use mmap()

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
One of my friends from college, the second most gifted programmer I ever
met (and that's because chance found me sharing a taxi with rms the
first time he gave a talk in Ireland), currently stacks shelves in a
supermarket. (Just to illustrate, in his third year in college, while
trying to write a game, he wrote his own windowing system.)

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
His own windowing system? Like, doing raw hardware access like most X
servers do, or just chaining onto something else? (Like Xnest, except,
of course, not doing a mini X server, but doing a mini
whatever-his-server-was)

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
It was in DOS, so there was assembly which controlled DOS's video
interrupt, on top of which he wrote various functions to draw shapes, on
top of which he had higher level windowing functions.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
I know plenty of people who didn't even get the chance to screw up in
the ways I did, and who had no other choice but to accept these sorts of
jobs.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Yeah, I figured it certainly wouldn't be because they <b>want</b> to work at
<em>[a supermarket]</em>. Or a gas station. Or any other low-wage dead end job.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Well, just to point out that it hasn't been all negative, I would never
have found the drive or sense of self-acceptance I now have without
working in the worst place I can imagine :)

<p>
I've also learned how well I can keep my head in a crisis, which is pretty
well. I've been faced with large fires in an area covered in fat,
massive gas leaks - the steps I took are now the company policy,
