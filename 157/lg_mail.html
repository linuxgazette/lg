Quoting Michael Makuch (linuxgazette at makuch dot org):
</p>

<p>
[You wrote to tag-owner@lists.linuxgazette.net.  I've decided to CC this
response to TAG.]
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Curious. I am subscribed to TAG with the address
&gt; linuxgazette at makuch dot org.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I accidentally sent a message to TAG just now from
&gt; mike8 at makuch dot org, yet the message went through to the list.
&gt; 
&gt; There seems to be a problem with the list if email from any ole
&gt; unregistered email address can send to it...
</pre>

<p>
{sigh}  No, it's a deliberate list configuration.  You're absolutely
right that that particular list configuration is archaic and essentially
never seen (otherwise) on a usable mailing list in this decade, because
of the continually rising spam problem.  TAG has always been set up to
permit non-subscriber posting because of its unique intended role:  It's
supposed to permit any <em>reader</em> of _Linux Gazette_ to address the
mailing list to converse with The Answer Gang.  Doing so of course makes
it <em>very</em> vulnerable to spam.  
</p>

<p>
You will probably have noticed that some spam <em>does</em> get through my MTA
and mailing list software defences.  I (as listadmin and MTA owner)
then manually analyse ASAP any spam that does so, and take immediate
action to ensure that no further mail from that (pick one; whatever
seems most effective and least disruptive of legitimate mail) SMTP HELO
string, or sending address, or sending domain, or IP will be accepted in
the future.  That is of course a no-win strategy with unavoidable
collateral damage, but it's the best I can contrive under the
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
TAG is the only mailing list with that configuration I know that's not
utterly overwhelmed with spam and thereby made useless, so I must be
doing something right.  But the possibility of it, too, getting
overwhelmed is always present.

<h3>Mandrake v9.1 on a Dell CPi D300XT</h3>
<p>
<b><p>
EJB [ejb at intergate.com]

</p>
</b><br />
<b>Wed, 19 Nov 2008 13:02:14 -0500</b>
</p>

<p>
Folks;
</p>

<p>
Several years ago, on a whim while at an OfficMax store I came across a sale 
going on regarding Mandrake v7.0 Linux and dis-satisfaction with MS (and the 
lower sales price) gave me reason enough to purchase the Linux package ... 
from the view of an owner/operator of several units - best thing I think I 
ever did. Couldn't believe that Linux software went on as smoothly as it did 
- and it worked - well mostly it worked but it did it well enough for me to 
keep an eye on the Linux OS which were available.
</p>

<p>
Recently I pulled an old Dell Latitude CPi D330XT out of "storage", deciding 
to keep it as a back up and fully operational unit and once again I've come 
across an old problem, one I never did solve in the past.
</p>

<p>
What I have is the following:
</p>

<p>
. A Dell D300XT laptop with a 10GB HD and 256kRam
</p>

<p>
. Mandrake v9.1 Linux and MS 98SE for Operating Systems
</p>

<p>
With disk partitioning, I've set or better, limited the HD space to just 2GB, 
with Mandrake v9.1 getting the rest of the available HD space. Yes, it does 
work/fit and very nicely at that but ...
</p>

<p>
PROBLEM I: SOUND - how do you get Linux to recognize the built-in sound 
card/chip which is available with these old Dell machines? At present,there 
is no sound at all and there is little doubt here but that and for want of a 
better term, "it's there" and it's just a case of finding out how to activate 
it.
</p>

<p>
PROBLEM II: PPP - It's timing out. I can get the dialer to dial in to the ISP 
but there's no data flow going on and the PPP times out. How do I get this 
software to "click" and connect?
</p>

<p>
PROBLEM III: SCANNER - I have an old (but very reliable V300 Microtech scanner 
but I can't get the Linux software system to recognize that the scanner is 
there. Win98SE will recognize it and operate it and there's no doubt here but 
that Linux will do it to - if I find and "set all the switches" in the proper 
manner. 
</p>

<p>
I'm open to any and all ideas and suggestions.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for your time an interset.
</p>

<p>
Hi Everyone,
</p>

<p>
I am working on a collage creation script in bash and am using find to 
get a list of all jpg files in a given directory. However find always 
returns the image names in the same order so the collage tends to have 
images from the same photo set i.e. at a given time it will have the 
most of the images from a particular subfolder.
</p>

<p>
What I want to do is get a list of random image file names from the 
system and then use it to create the collage, so that the collage looks 
more varied.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I have done so far to get a random file name:
</p>

<pre>
   awk "NR==$(($RANDOM % $(wc -l fi.txt| awk '{print $1}')))" fi.txt
</pre>

<p>
where fi.txt was created using
</p>

<pre>
   find . -iname "*.jpg" -true | sed 's/ /\\ /g' &gt;fi.txt
</pre>

<p>
Now, this way works but I have to create a temp file which I want to 
avoid. Is there some way of getting find to return results in a random 
order? I tried searching the web but didn't find any useful results.
</p>

<p>
I am attaching the current version of the Collage creation script with 
this email to give you an idea of how it works. This version is without 
randomization of the filenames.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance for the help.
</p>

<p>
- Suramya
</p>

<p>
PS: Please do give your feedback/suggestions on how the script can be 
improved in addition to a solution <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Hi list,
</p>

<p>
Hope you all are well.
</p>

<p>
I am trying to modify the /etc/inittab file to add more key combination. One 
of the reasons is to shut down the system.  I have added this line in the 
inittab
</p>

<pre>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`
#shut down wit ctrl+alt+end
ce:12345:ctrlaltend:/sbin/halt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</pre>

<p>
but "init q" reports
	
<pre>
	:ctrlaltend:   unknown action field
</pre>

<p>
Could any one kindly point out my mistake ? I like to define some more key 
combination like ctrl+alt+&lt; ; ctrl+alt+s   etc to call commands. How can I 
define these key combination ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

Hello,
</p>

<p>
Hope you all are well.
</p>

<p>
I have designed a script which compress some files and store those files in a 
folder named by date like 10-11-2008 ( for 10th Nov 2008 ) and uploads it in 
a remote ftp server through lftp. the script runs every day. As the FTP space 
is little after every 15 or so days the FTP space qouata is full. I like to 
include a section in the script which will check the folders in the ftp 
server through lftp and deletes the folders which  already 10 days matured.
</p>

<p>
Can any one suggest me how to do this throug lftp ?
</p>

<p>
thanks a lot

  GFDL 1.3: Wikipedia's exit permit
  by Jonathan Corbet
  November 5, 2008
</p>

<p>
  [...]
  Members of the Wikipedia project have wanted to move away from the GFDL
  for some time.  [...]  The presence of the "or any later version"
  language allows Wikipedia content to be distributed under the terms of
  later versions of the GFDL with no need to seek permission from
  individual contributors. Surprisingly, the Wikimedia Foundation has
  managed to get the Free Software Foundation to cooperate in the use of
  the "or any later version" permission to carry out an interesting legal
  hack.
  [...]
</p>

<p>
  In other words, GFDL-licensed sites like Wikipedia have a special,
  nine-month window in which they can relicense their content to the
  Creative Commons attribution-sharealike license. This works because (1)
  moving to version 1.3 of the license is allowed under the "or any later
  version" terms, and (2) relicensing to CC-BY-SA is allowed by GFDL 1.3.
</p>

<p>
LWN articles become available to the general public after eight days, so
non-subscribers will be able to read the story starting Nov. 13.

<p>
Much of the patent portfolio of some of the world's biggest software
companies has become worthless overnight, thanks to a ruling yesterday by
the US patent court.
</p>

<p>
The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) in Washington DC has
decided that in the future, instead of automatically granting a patent for a
business practice, there will be a specific testing procedure to determine
how patentable is that process.
</p>

<p>
The decision is a nearly complete reversal of the court's controversial
State Street Bank judgment of 1998, which started the stampede for patenting
business practices.

The OpenLibrary is a project from the Internet Archive; in short,
they're building a Google Books-type catalogue of titles, integrated
with the ability to search the text of those titles that have been

have, though, is a 'scan on demand' feature for any book available at
Boston Public Library -- if the book hasn't already been scanned, a
