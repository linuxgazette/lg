So... I signed myself up to help process our monthly mail. During 'Basic

stuff.

<blockQuote>
Oh, how I did grin.

<blockQuote>
So, as this is the last issue of the year, and  have to learn how to
format the mail in the correct way, we get to have more
off-topic stuff than usual. Watch, as The Answer Gang cringe to see
stuff they said two years ago come back to bite them!

Mostly, though, running here in the upstairs office, summertime about
80-85 F ambient makes a big difference over temps here now. Higher
ambients make everything work harder, and Ben's salt-water environment
can't be helping anything, eh?

Actually, on this boat, it's not a problem; steel boats are notoriously
dry (whereas fiberglass is definitely not.) As to the effect of "salt
air", all my years of experience with electronics aboard - even those
that are not made for marine use - say that it's a damned myth. Dampness
will kill'em pretty quick, but here in Florida and in the tropics, there
isn't very much - consequently, electronics aboard tend to be quite
long-lived (as long as they survive the weird power fluctuations,
hurricane damage, and so on.)

The Register reports 34% <u>more</u> spam vs. legit email passing SPF
authentication. Amazingly enough, they manage to get it right after that
nonsense-based headline (SPF isn't <u>intended</u> to somehow magically
recognize spam.)

Forcing spammers to register their own throwaway domains and publish

<u>That,</u> of course, being the real point of SPF: creating a cost for
spammers if they abuse the system. I just wish the folks at the Reg had
provided more light and less noise; the mass of the clueless (which,
unfortunately, includes many of those who influence the buy-in
decisions) does NOT need to be given ammunition. Even blanks can be
dangerous, at short range.

Quoting John Leyden:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>&gt; It doesnt make a lot of sense to make filtering decisions based purely
&gt; on the fact that the sender is authenticated....
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
...and only an idiot, or someone who hasn't bothered to read the
reference description or any of the technical articles, but is racing
against deadline to file a drivel story, would think otherwise.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>&gt; so the approach was never going to be a cure-all as we've noted [link]
&gt; before.
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
One suspects Leyden isn't even able to <u>spell</u> "joe-job", let alone know
how they work.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>&gt; As long as spammers comply with the protocol by not spoofing the
&gt; sender address, their messages will not be stopped by SPF
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
SPF, of course, does not "stop messages".

"Au fond du temple saint" or just the Pearl Fishers duet, is a big duet
for tenor and baritone. Never fails to give me goose bumps.

I'd suggest the Placido Domingo/Sherrill Milnes recording or, somewhat
older, Jussi Bjoerling/Robert Merrill. Worth looking up.

You guys have got me interested. Unfortunately, the only versions I
could find for an introductory listen - MP3s by David Gilmour (yes, that
David Gilmour) and somebody named David Hobson - are uninspiring at
best. I'm sure that Placido Domingo would sound great, but &lt;shrug&gt; he
could sing the Los Angeles Yellow Pages and people would sit through the
entire performance and come out talking about it being "the best thing
I've ever heard".

Fair Credit Billing Act:
If you ordered something using a credit card and the item never arrived
or the company you ordered it from went bankrupt under the Fair Credit
Billing Act you don't have to pay for something you don't get.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That's why its always best to pay with a credit card so you have some
protection in case of a problem. A debit (ATM) card does NOT offer the
same protection.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you think you've been improperly charged or have not received the
proper item, immediately contact your credit card company and ask them
how to dispute the charge. You must do this in WRITING within 60 days of
the charge.

Thanks so much for sending Help Me Hank's answers to sundry common
questions.
If you're getting this response, or even if you don't, it means the
Linux Gazette Answer Gang have received your letter.  Because of the
huge volume of e-mail we get, we delegate some mail to some rather
potted mailbot scripts, like the one that composed this reply.

When we do read your letter, if there's anything we can do to help you
make Linux just a little more fun, someone (or somebot) will be in touch
with you as soon as possible!
</blockQuote>

In the meantime, please scroll down this e-mail, and you may find the

<blockQuote>
Commonly Questioned Answers:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
AUTOMOBILE PROBLEMS:  Determined use of Linux can prevent the need to
use an automobile in the first place, thereby neatly averting the
messy problems attendant thereto.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
AIRLINE TICKETS:  A variety of excellent Linux-base Web browsers such as
Galeon, Mozilla, Phoenix, Konqueror, Opera, w3m, Skipstone, and lynx can
be used to purchase (and sell) airline tickets.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
BANKING:  Similarly, the same Linux-based browsers can be used with any
bank that has a competently run on-line operation.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
CABLE TV:  The Linux-based TiVo personal TV recorder makes a superb
addition to any cable television setup.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
CELL PHONES:  Embedded Linux distributions are said to be in use in a
number of cellular 'phones and PDA combo devices.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
CHILD CARE/DAY CARE/ADOPTION &amp; FOSTER CARE:  Your use of Linux should
help you increase productivity and improve protection of data integrity
to the point where you can more comfortably afford the major costs of
child care.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
CREDIT and DEBIT CARDS:  The less money you spend on forced purchases
dictated by proprietary-software treadmills, the less likely you are to
be in debt.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
DEBT COLLECTION:  Is a bill collector unfairly hounding you?  Set up a
Linux-based answering-machine appliance to filter your calls for you.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
DENTISTS:  Think of all the wear and tear you'll save on your pearlies
from not having to deal with continual bluescreen wipeouts and viruses.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE:  Which do you think is more likely to be
compensated as a skilled profession, point-and-drool OSes of limited
function and high maintenance costs, or Linux?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICE:  Perform a social service:  Run a Linux
installfest, one of these coming weekends.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
HEALTH CARE AND DOCTORS:  Use Linux.  The frustration-caused stroke you
prevent may be your own.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
HEALTH CLUBS:  All the rebuild, debugging, and data-recovery time you
save by running on Linux can be spent out pleasantly hiking in the
woods, swimming, or walking on trails with your friends and loved ones,
instead.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
HOMEOWNER/RENTER RIGHTS AND PROBLEMS:  Insist on your right to run your
home's operations using Linux-based control systems.  Larry Wall does!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
IDENTITY THEFT:  You're less likely to have key sensitive information
stolen if you run an OS where security isn't just a daydream.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
INSURANCE:  So, run Linux, already.  It's cheap insurance.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
LEGAL PROBLEMS, REPRESENTATION AND ATTORNEYS:  Are less likely to be a
concern if you exercise due diligence with your data processing.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
MOVERS and shakers.  Be one.  Run Linux.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
NURSING HOMES:  Um, Linux for them, too.  
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
RECALLS:  We don't need'em.  Upgrades, yes.  And we throw in the source
code for free.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
SCAMS:  Filter out those Nigerian spams.  Run Bogofilter on Linux.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
SHOPPING:  Yep, Linux-based Web browsers again.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
SMALL CLAIMS COURT:  See legal problems.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
TELEMARKETING AND JUNK MAIL:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
UTILITIES:  We've got directories crammed with 'em.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
VACATION AND TRAVEL INSURANCE &amp; PACKAGES:  Pretty much the same as with
health clubs.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
GENERAL CONSUMER INFORMATION AND HOW TO FILE COMPLAINT:  Run Linux, and
you can start being a producer rather than just a consumer.  I mean,
isn't it depressing to have your defining trait be considered to be your
ingestion and processing of material, as if you were cattle?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you still haven't found the answer, you may be hearing from us!  Or
maybe not.  It might be just those voices in your head again.  Please
understand that we help a lot of people, and amuse the rest.  Thank you
so much for your understanding.  Stand up already, so you can overstand

Hi,

My only guess is that you're using Linux (good man!)
and that you've neglected to realise that you
currently have the BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death)
screensaver running.
</blockQuote>

I know it is confusing, especially as you've probably
only just made the cross-over from Windows to Linux,
but bear with us, the BSOD screensaver is only a

anymore. YOU'RE FREE

We've just wrapped up the third week of a 200-hour, five-week teacher
training. This week was the start of learning the teaching methodology
rather than the postures themselves. This is one of the hardest - and
one of the most satisfying - things I've ever done in my life.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The teaching is 100% experiential; the only stuff that comes out of your
head is the wording. The postures, the stuff you give to the students,
<EM>has</EM> to come out of your own body experience and observation... and
getting your body to talk to you in ways that can be translated so that
others will hear it is, um, an interesting challenge. (A huge,
heart-felt <TT>/namaste/</TT> in the direction of Deva Parnell, our teacher, who
has managed to make it not only possible but damn near inescapable. If
you stick with it, it _happens._ Sticking with it, opening your heart
and soul and letting the old scars get light and air and healing...
that's the challenge. And the pain, and the incredible joy.)

Ouch! Just to illustrate a point, though: one of the girls in the
teacher training has a fractured disc - and she is able to adapt without
much trouble. It's <EM>all</EM> about honoring your limitations. I have to use
straps and cushions for support for a number of poses myself, since I'm
not all that flexible (but far, <EM>far</EM> more flexible than I was at this
time last year) - and that's not any problem either. Being able to work
from where you are is what matters.

I had a cortizone
injection and that took away the pain, then I went to physical therapy
for a couple months and learned a ton; i.e. my left leg is shorter than
my right and that puts a sheen (=diagonal gravitational pressure)
across my body, and I walk on the inside of my feet (flat footed, which I
never knew what that meant).  I learned some core exercises, which of
course yoga emphasizes too.

<blockquote><pre>  Shear \Shear\, n. [AS. sceara. See {Shear}, v. t.]

[ ... ]

     3. (Engin.) An action, resulting from applied forces, which
        tends to cause two contiguous parts of a body to slide
        relatively to each other in a direction parallel to their
        plane of contact; -- also called {shearing stress}, and
        {tangential stress}.
        [1913 Webster]

     4. (Mech.) A strain, or change of shape, of an elastic body,
        consisting of an extension in one direction, an equal
        compression in a perpendicular direction, with an
        unchanged magnitude in the third direction.

I'd been using the term in its engineering sense long before I heard it
applied to anatomical structures; very common usage there. It's also
used in geology and meteorology. In all of these cases, it's spelled
with an 'a' - I'd never seen it as "sheer" before, which to me means
"thin" (as in fabric) or, when used as a verb, relates to sheering
(e.g., a ship anchored in a cross-current will sheer about, with the
anchor forming the point of its cone.)

My dictionary is Webster's New World, 2nd College Ed., 1982.  It says
sheer (to turn aside) is "a variant of shear, prob'ly influenced by Dutch
or Low German 'scheren' (to cut, warp away)".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
sheer (thin/transparent) is "from Middle English schere, prob'ly a variant
of scere (free, exempt), from Old Norse skaerr (bright/clear) akin to
German schier, from Indo-European *skai- (to glimmer)".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
shear (to cut/tear) is "from Middle English scheren, from Old English
scieran, akin to German scheren, from Indo-European *(s)ker- (to cut)".
All the definitions have to do with cutting or tearing, none have to do
with going a strange direction.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But I didn't learn the words from a dictionary.  I remembered sheer(2)
from all the Band-Aid commercials.  So when the PT said sheer, that was
the first time I encountered it meaning pressure in a direction, and so
I assumed it was spelled the same way.  I didn't think of it being
related to shears, an object which was far from my mind since I'm not a
gardener nor a seamster.

But wrestling didn't cause most of my problems, it just revealed them.
My wrists don't bend backward, it's hard to lean forward or
move my legs far apart, I have to watch to avoid twisting my ankle, and
god forbid a policeman might arm-bar me someday and pull too hard.  The
leaning forward part mostly manifests itself in an irritation when I
have to pick up a piece of paper off the floor, but occsionally I can
barely lean forward enough to put my socks and shoes on.  You know that
position where you sit on the floor with your legs straight in front of
you?

Sure, Paschimottanasana (Intense Back Stretch.) Six months ago, I couldn't
sit in it at all - couldn't get my upper body past vertical. Nowadays, I
can get ~20 degrees of forward bend while keeping an erect spine, and can
get within a foot or so of touching my forehead to my knees with a
relaxed spine; one of the two greatest improvements in my flexibility. I
love the damned thing.

The best advice I can give you is, don't push it to the edge. That's
where you get tired - and where you also get almost no benefit. Rule #1
of yoga, from the guy who formulated the practice and the postures as we
know them today (as contrasted against meditation): <TT>/Sthira</TT> sukam
asanam/ ("The posture is steady and comfortable".) Push past that point,
and you get no benefit. This sounds weird and wrong to someone used to
gym workouts, but - believe it. It's the core of what really works.

Erich Schiffmann, in his "Yoga - The Spirit and Practice of Moving into
Stillness", has a very good description of the above process:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
(from Chapter 8, "Playing the Edge")
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"You should <TT>never</TT> be in pain as you practice yoga. Your practice
should not be a painful ordeal but rather an expression of joy. Pain is
most easily defined as any sensation you do not like, and it always
invokes a natural withdrawal mechanism. When you put your hand on a hot
stove, for example, instantly you take it off. Before you're even aware
that your hand is on the stove, it's off. This is a built-in
self-protective device.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The same withdrawal mechanism is activated whenever a yoga stretch
begins to hurt. Muscles clamp down and contract in order to protect
themselves from overstretching. They are suddenly less willing, fearful,
and they resist the stretch - naturally. And they do this, to whatever
small or large degree, before you're even aware it's happening. This is
blatantly at odds with your initial intention to stretch, open, and
expand your physical boundaries. Therefore, by pushing into pain, you're
actually working against yourself. One foot is on the accelerator and
one foot is on the brake."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(In medical literature, this is one of the four types of reflexive
muscle action, and is called the flexion reflex. The myotic reflex is
why you want to avoid bouncing when stretching.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In another chapter (3, "Why yoga?"), he talks about what happens
internally - and this is right on the dot based on my experience, and is
the core of what yoga does for me. Mind you, I'd been <EM>feeling</EM> this for
most of a year now... and only recently ran across the words for it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"You learn to open up by relaxing, being fearless, and becoming
increasingly defenseless. Defensiveness, or shielding, is what creates
the discomfort associated with growth."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
For me, it's all about having the courage to strip off the armor and
trusting my own internal resources for my safety and security. Toughest
challenge I've ever faced, gotta tell ya... oh yeah, I forgot: it's just
stretching exercises, nothing more. Skip all that fake new-age stuff.

[shrug] That doesn't come from the yoga tradition. Or, really, even
Hinduism, from what I've learned of it both recently and previously -
but it can be easy to interpret that way. "Yoga" means "union" (from
"yuj", or yoke), and can be interpreted in many ways - one of which is
union with your $DEITY_OF_CHOICE, but certainly does not have to be. My
take on it is union among body, mind, and spirit, which seems to me to
be very close to Patanjali's writings, and is also the most applicable
to the practice of it.

Sure. Is calculus religious just because it was developed by a religious
man in a religious atmosphere within a religious society? Not in my
perception. Although some aspects of yoga do deal with the spiritual
side, which can blur the line and create lots of shades of gray.

The "Loka" is one of the oldest traditional chants - and has the exact
"non-religion-affiliated" feel that I associate with yoga. You don't
have to believe in any supernatural beings to agree with the idea behind
it; I recently ran across a post by an M.D., an Indian woman who is
non-religious, whose father (also non-religious) taught her to chant the
Loka daily when she was little. Her take on it was that it shaped her
entire life philosophy from then on. I couldn't see that as a bad thing
even if I tried.

I've actually looked up the Sanskrit, including the root words, and the
above translation is mine - although my teacher, Deva, translated it
almost exactly the same way. "All worlds" doesn't refer to planets but
to the three worlds (or realms) of perception and action - gross,
subtle, and causal - in which the three levels of ourselves - the
physical, the mental, and the spiritual - operate. (That's not too
shabby of a modern formulation, for some dude of 5000 years ago or so;
they were pretty damned good logicians, I was surprised to find. The
Greeks had nothing on these lads, and appeared on the scene quite a bit
later.)

Philosophies and religions are easy to conflate - they both deal with
many of the same elements, and religion, in the hierarchy of organized
knowledge, is a sub-field of philosophy (further subdivided into theism,
philosophical theology, and philosophy of religion.) Although there are
still gray areas, my distinction between the two comes down to deities
and faith: if supernatural beings plus faith are required articles, it's
a religion.

Interestingly, many religious people report that their spiritual path
was made easier by yoga. I wouldn't know, of my own experience - but I

But then I found an instructor who does
everything in English, doesn't use the religious terminology, constantly
explains the physical benefits of the particular moves ("when you
breathe out try to open a little more space in your hips"), etc.  Oh,
and he's a punk with a mohawk, so he's all right.

Although my instructions would be more like "on your next exhalation,
flutter your knees slightly to create more opening in your hips"; people
usually don't know what to do when you tell them to "open a little more
space in your hips", and you have to associate it with specific
guidance.

Heh. That, again, is shorthand for advanced students who know the longer
version, e.g.: "Imagine that you could breathe through the soles of your
feet. Now, feel the energy penetrate toward the core on each inhalation,
and let go of the tension on each exhalation." Much of the imagery
drives internal states that can be extremely difficult to describe
verbally but actually <u>happen</u> for pretty much everybody when guided
with it. However, using the shorthand inappropriately can lead to
confusion (viz. yourself) and worse, take people out of their internal
experience.

"Hatha yoga" just refers to "physical yoga", as contrasted against the
meditation stuff. There's a variety of types as well as styles (most of
the latter are within the hatha type) - Karma, Bhakti, Jnana, Raja,
Kundalini, a few others. The styles - e.g. Bikram, Kripalu, Atma,
Iyengar, etc. - are variations of Hatha. It's not that important,
though; I was just curious.

That sounds much more like what I do, but three minutes is a <EM>long</EM> time
- way too much for beginners. I can hold most of the postures for three
minutes, but that's about my limit - and I couldn't have done it prior
to this teacher training. It takes good alignment, a lot of body
awareness, and (above all) deep respect for and knowledge of your own
limitations. That stuff takes a while to get for most people.

That's supposed to get you used to holding
yourself up on your joints rather than using muscle, but I couldn't
really get it.  I liked what I was learning and the instructors and
students, but I just didn't want to get into the organization and belts
and crazy moves, plus dedicating five days a week to it, and never
knowing what it was going to be like from day to day.  So I'm back to
yoga and weights and running, and occasional submission wrestling.

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That "fatigant" issue is one of those many subtle, tiresome (!)
ambiguities one may encounter in the French language. Generally
speaking, the "-ant" suffix, applied to a verb, is just like the
"-ing" one in English. Therefore, the first meaning of "fatigant"
is "tiring" (the infinitive form being "fatiguer", i.e. "to make
tired").
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, its present participle form (the one ending in "-ant")
can also be used as a mere adjective, often with a somewhat
different meaning: "boring", "tiresome".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
OTOH, when you mean "tired", "weary", you have to use the past
participle form "fatigu" (actually as an adjective, too).
Unfortunately, the correct spelling depends on the subject's gender
and number:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre> She's tired = Elle est fatigue
                               ^
 We, husbands, are tired = Nous, les maris, sommes fatigus
                                                          ^
 The barmaids are... = ... fatigues
                                  ^^
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
But:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre> Dcidment, ce type est fatigant = That guy is definitely tiresome.
 C'est un boulot fatigant = It's a tiring job.
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
As you can see, the true meaning depends on the context.

LOL. There's another funny litteral translation: "I have appetite".
The familiar expression, often used in conversations, is:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
J'ai la dalle.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
but that's hardly translatable as is. I guess "I've got the paving stone"
or "the slab" (thanks, Harrap's) doesn't make any sense, LOL.
Actually the above means "I'm starving" (see also "Je crve la dalle",
which has yet a stronger meaning). But never say that while your
respectful, 500-euro-three-piece-suit-wearing self is attending a
political cocktail party at the lyse -- unless you're covered by
a strong diplomatic immunity (only then does everybody laugh).

It's the same "rule" for such expressions as "I'm cold/thirsty"
(j'ai froid/soif), etc. English grammar is more logical, actually.

You're quite right, Didier. Actually, the directory

them). When I ran the same command on filenames that
were short (<TT>/bin</TT>) for example, it worked ok, by
replacing "head -2" back to "head -1". Very strange!!

Thank you very much, Pete - I'm fairly familiar with St. Augustine
(spent about four months there the last time I sailed through), but this
is all great info! There's also a little "all natural" restaurant within

if you like NY style Pizza try Pizza garden (on Hypollita St.)
for great spanish food try the Columbia on St. Georges St.
The best caramel apples can be found at Savannah Sweets--also great fudge,
and any other candy made with caramel (they make the caramel right in the
shop) (also on St. Georges St.)
Great sticky buns and cookies can be had at The Bunnery
and, just across from there is Cousins Sandwich shop, which does a great
fresh-squeezed Key Limeade.
One more--if you can get there early in the day, The Spanish Bakery does
great empanadas and breads.  It's kind of tucked away off of St. Georges
St., so you have to look for the signs.

Certainly growing up, there were entire portions of children's books I didn't
understand, or later found out I misunderstood, because of the language
differences.  For instance, Paddington Bear lived in the "box room".  I
assumed that referred to the room's shape, that it was small and square.
Later I found out it's a room where you keep stuff in boxes, thus a storage
room.

That is true, Mike. My room is a box room! Actually, I

It doesn't matter.  We just enjoy needling each other.  The British spellings
are more "correct" in that they invented the language.  But many American
spellings are shorter and more practical: draught/draft, colour/color,
encyclopaedia/encyclopedia.  Actually, many of these spellings were coined
specifically by Webster et al in the early 1800s mainly to thumb their noses
at the Brits, and only secondarily to pull the spelling closer to the
pronounciation.

Historically, there was no standard spelling until recently: Shakespeare spelled
his own name three different ways.  Chaucer wrote "e" (bite) and "gh" (night)
because he actually pronounced them that way; they weren't silent.  But for a
few hundred years after that (if I got my dates right), the upper classes in
England didn't even speak English but French, so the people who made the
language survive through those years were illiterate and had no sense of
spelling.  So by the time English became respectable again (1500s?),
the pronounciation had changed significantly, but the older spellings were
retained.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Throw dialects into the mix and you get an unsolvable can of worms, especially
when homonyms and the readability of older documents is taken into consideration.
If half a family moves one place and half a family moves another place, there
will start to be differences in their pronounciation and word choice in a
couple generations, and this happens so gradually they don't realize it.
The effect is diminished now because of global communication but it still
happens.  We're getting a lot of words now with no common standard.
Al-Qaida or Al-Quaeda?  Pronounced "kay" or "ky" or "ka-EE"?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You can't devise a phonetic spelling system that covers even the major differences
between English dialects.  Should car be spelled kar or ka?  Is the Tube a tyoob or
a toob?  What do you do with the vowels in, "It ain't right, mate, it isn't time."
(Compare how George Bush, Mick Jagger and U2 pronounce "time".)  Even a simple
word like "no" is nohw in general American, naow in Cockney and no in Scotland.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The homonym problem is this: English already has way too many homonyms for its
own good.  See, sea and C.  If you spell them all the same, it quadruples the
job of trying to figure out what someone else is writing.  On top of that, some
words rhyme in some dialects but not in others.  This happens even in the US
in spite of our mobility.  Does aunt sound like ant or is it "ahnt"?  Does
"my Aunt Ant" sound just funny or totally hilarious?  Is there an "e" on the
end of coyote?  Do you pronounce merry, marry and Mary all the same?  "You say
tomayto and I say tomahto.  Eether, ither, neether, nither, let's call the
whole thing off."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The old-documents problem is this: modern people can read Twain, Dickens and
Tom Paine without any problems.  They can read Shakespeare with some help.  But
if we change the spelling system, kids will either have to learn two systems,
or the old books will have to be translated (which won't happen with obscure
works till much later).  (Oh, and the translations won't be in the public
domain, thanks to the perpetual copyright extensions that are in vogue now.)
Too many adults will flatly refuse to change spelling systems (we're still
using fahrenheit and miles and quarts, after all).  So that's it.

Another thing which fascinates me (and I wish we had

"grocery" shopping, you get brown-paper bags!! That's
soo cool. We get crappy plastic ones over here

Shopping bags were always paper until twenty years or so ago.  Then plastic
bags appeared and were touted as "superior" because they had handles and were
easier for the elderly to carry, supposedly.  But there was an environmentalist
backlash almost immediately because they were made from oil and non-recyclable.
But pretty soon the researchers figured out that the, um, Total Cost of
Ownership (environmentally speaking) was the same either way.  So both remained,
and cashiers have been doomed forevermore to ask, "Paper or plastic?", and if
you don't say they invariably choose plastic.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I was surprised in Russia and Germany that they charge extra for the bags, because
in the US they're always free.  Although some stores give you a 5-cent discount if
you bring your own bag, and some will even give you a discount if you use a
backpack (but not consistently).  I always take my backpack when I go shopping
(and my big backpack to Costco), for environmental reasons.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I can't imagine why anybody would think paper bags are cool.  They exist, and they
aren't made from oil, but if you put anything wet into them, they disintigrate.  If
you put anything heavy in them and carry them from the top, they tear unless you
double bag.  And if you live in Tacoma, Washington, or Oregon City, Oregon, you
can smell the pulp mills, a fine delicacy Ben is well aware of....

India is now plastic country, you get plastic bags to carry everything.
Except that the shopkeeper won't understand you if you say 'plastic

Yes.  Fruits and vegetables are called produce (PRO-duce).  Grocery stores
used to mean the little corner food store, which has now become the big
corner supermarket.  The little corner food store has been replaced by the
"convenience store" like 7-11 or those mini-marts at the gas stations.
They mostly have cigarettes, candy, hot dogs/sandwiches, juice/pop/beer,
newspapers and that's about it.  You're lucky if you can find an orange or a
banana in one of those places, but don't even think of finding lettuce.
Nowadays frozen burritos are pretty common though.  Some people call them
"Kwik-E-Marts" in honor of the Simpsons.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It seems wrong to call 7-11 and AM/PM grocery stores because they don't carry a
whole line of fruits/vegetables/bread/meats.  But paradoxically, in the inner
cities (not in the suburbs) there are little independent shops that carry the
same sort of wares as the convenience chains, and these <EM>are</EM> called grocery
stores, perhaps in honor of the ma-and-paw shops that were their predecessors.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In Edward Rutherford's <u>London</u>  it says the word "grocery" originally meant
people who buy by the gross, thus the wholesale-to-retail middlemen.

So, I went and did it. Perhaps inspired by Jay's example, or maybe
because I've been thinking about it for a long time now - and a pilot
friend of mine had this one for sale at a great price.

<blockQuote>
Whew. Sure brings back a lot of memories. Racing, cruising, long rides
on the backroads of California and New York...

a bearded Floridian in your archives, you'll want to put him back <u>very
carefully,</u> and maybe pour him a large mug of Scrumpy Jack, or even two
if you want to be really safe. It's the only way to handle them;
otherwise, they've got a <EM>nasty</EM> bite, and it'll fester for weeks.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(Mmmm, Scrumpy Jack. Damn but that's good stuff; I'm having to put up
with Woodchuck's and Kelly's instead, which is OK but not the real
thing.)

If you're a cider fan, Somerset in England is the place to go. I used to
live in that county, and there is cider aplenty....

To think I am teetotal, too. I'll just stick to pure apple juice.

I'm not a big-time drinker - got fairly smart about it during my Army
days - but I certainly appreciate good potables. Scrumpy Jack is
definitely very high on my list; those folks really know their business.
They've got a little bit of practice, mind you... [ a quick Google
intermission ] yep, Symonds has been making cider since 1727.

Not a Somerset firm though. They're from that other great cider county,
Herefordshire. Definitely not to be confused with Hertfordshire, unless
you're easily confused that is

The toy store in the next town to where I grew up used to have a

went, probably, 6 feet high (it felt taller than that, but I was only 8

to Florida, and being amazed at how it had <EM>shrunk</EM> since I left.

It is good. I have all of Escher's paintings in book form, as well as
some rather large posters on me bedroom wall.
