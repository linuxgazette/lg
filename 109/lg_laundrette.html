I've been trying to think of ways to add something to next month's issue 
to mark that it's the December issue; the issue of the holiday season. 
<!-- #That Ben could feel unappreciated made me think that it might be nice
to  -->
I thought it might be nice to
have a "Greeting Card" section (thoroughly off-topic, so it's Laundrette 
territory
[<a href="#laundrette.jimmy1.1">1</a>]) 
where we can leave each other the gift of a few kind words 
under the virtual tree.

<p>
One obvious problem is that it's embarassing to forget to mention 
someone, and thanking everyone around here for everything would probably 
take us all much longer than a month, but I think this can work if we 
try to grab some of the holiday spirit in advance.

<p>
I'll try to get the ball rolling; I'll just mention the people who've 
participated in this thread to excuse memory, lack of time, etc.

<p>
Ben: thank you for prodding some of my random thoughts into a form I 
could shape into an article, on so many occassions.

<p>
Heather: the CPU fan you tried to DCC me is hanging in my virtual 
stocking; the thought counts double for comedy.

<p>
Thomas: Thanks for inspiring my KGPG and Kile articles. (Now that I've 
offended you by naming you as inspiration for something KDE related, let 
me point out that I mean you inspired the idea of introducing the back 
end as well as front end  :) 

<p>
Mike: Thanks for keeping me in touch with stuff that happens in the real 
world. It's a big place, but I manage to not notice it a lot of the time.

<p>
Rick and Brian: Thanks for helping me to trick the readers into thinking 
 I can write. The fools!

<p>
<a name="laundrette.jimmy1.1"></a>
[1] I normally consider anything that comes from these lists to be fair 
game, but I'm going to make this an exception; if you like the idea of 
having this section, say so, and your thoughts will be added.

I'd also like to thank our readers (especially those who send feedback),
translators (hi Marcin!) and... well, everybody, basically. 'Tis the
Season.

<h3>As I Mature</h3>
<blockquote><em>[
My friend Mark sent this. I had to include it, after such a bout of 
sincerity.
]</em></blockquote>

<p> Now lads as we know I HATE chain mail thus I deleted the chain mail piece
fom the bottom of this email and instead I am sending this as a thought for
the day.

<p>
I've learned that you cannot make
someone love you. All you can do is
stalk them and hope they panic and give in.

<blockquote><em>[
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0809229897/">Not 
strictly true</a>

If it helps your defense in the inevitable trial, there's this chemical 
called phenylethylamine that's released when you fall in love. MDMA, the 
active ingredient of Ecstacy, has similar (though stronger) effects. If 
your solicitor doesn't know this, he/she can't get you off for diminished 
capacity.
]</em></blockquote>

<p>
I've learned that no matter how much I care,
some people are just assholes.

<blockquote><em>[
Aw... you remembered :)
]</em></blockquote>

<p>
I've learned that it takes years
to build up trust, and it only takes
suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.

<p>
I've learned that you can get by
on charm for about fifteen minutes.
After that, you'd better have a big willy
or huge boobs.

<p>
I've learned that you shouldn't
compare yourself to others - they are
more screwed up than you think.

<blockquote><em>[
<a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/psp/psp7761121.html">Scientifically 
proven!</a>
]</em></blockquote>

<p>
I've learned that you can keep vomiting
long after you think you're finished.

<blockquote><em>[
Hey, I'm not the only one!
]</em></blockquote>
<p>
I've learned that we are responsible
for what we do, unless we are celebrities.

<p>
I've learned that regardless of
how hot and steamy a relationship is at
first, the passion fades, and there had better
be a lot of money to take its place!

<p>
I've learned that 99% of the time when
something isn't working in your house, one
of your kids did it

<p>
I've learned that the people you care most
about in life are taken from you too soon
and all the less important ones just never go away.

"A group of geeks aimed to find out whether running cheap vodka through a
brita water filter would make it drinkable. They claim after several
passes through the filter the cheap vodka surpassed the premium Ketel One
in drinkability tests. I think they should have done the test 'double
blind' although drinking Vladmir Vodka probably could make you go blind
anyways... =)"

A blonde got lost in her car in a snowstorm. She remembered what her dad had 
once told her. ''If you ever get stuck in a snowstorm, wait for a snow plow 
and follow it.'' Pretty soon a snow plow came by, and she started to follow 
it. She followed the plow for about 45 minutes.

<p>
Finally, the driver of the truck got out and asked her what she was doing. 
She explained that her dad had told her if she ever got stuck in the snow, 
to follow a plow. The driver nodded and said, ''Well, I'm done with the 
parking lot here at Wal-Mart, now you can follow me over to K-Mart.''

A road construction manager needed to hire someone to paint the yellow lines 
down the middle of a newly constructed road. A blonde, a brunette, and a 
redhead all get hired. They are each assigned a section of the road. The 
first day, the blonde paints 2 miles, the redhead 1.5, and the brunette 
only 1. On the second day, the blonde paints 1 mile, the brunette 2, and 
the redheaed 2.5. On the third day, the blonde only gets 1/4 of a mile done, 
the redheaed 3, and the brunette 3.5. The manager decides to talk to the 
blonde.

<p>
"You haven't been painting as much road as you did on the first day,'' the 
manager said. ''What's the problem?''

<p>
''I'd be painting more, but the bucket keeps getting farther and farther 
away!''

<h3>U.S. Election</h3>

<p>
Normally, I'd be the first to complain when I see Americocentrism
[<a href="#laundrette.jimmy2.1">1</a>]: the
comment on a spelling change in Wikipedia, "Who the hell spells it
'centre'?" (um... the British, Irish, Australians, Canadians...); the
comment in LG72: 'Note the silent "e" in writeable. The configuration file
has it even though the ordinary word doesn't. The same applies to
browseable below. Actually, Samba accepts it either way, but Samba's
manpages use writeable.' (The smb.conf manpage once had 'writable: synonym
for writeable for people who can't spell' -- Samba was created by an
Australian).

<p>
That's just spelling: don't get me started on that MM/DD/YY thing, sports
analogies, or calling football soccer. This list would normally include
politics, but the U.S. elections were of great interest to most people,
Americans and non-Americans alike, and lead to some great comedy in the
wake of Bush's victory.

<p>
I will, however, concede on the "Leader of the Free World" title Americans
give to their leader (to the annoyance of every other citizen of a
democracy); even though the net result is the same, America's Constitution
does not <i>grant rights</i>, it merely establishes that they exist, and so
sets restrictions on the government; most others <i>do</i> grant rights.
Ireland's contitution, for example, grants freedom of association, of the
press, and guarantees a right to privacy, but includes loopholes so that
these rights only exist until you might need to exercise them; Americans
have an absolute right to remain silent when in police custody, but in
Ireland that only comes into effect once you've given your name and
address (so the police can harass you at will). 

<p>
<a name="laundrette.jimmy2.1"></a>
[1] Because I'm Irish: a) that means I'm not American (despite the
assumptions of Irish-Americans :); and b) complaining is our national
pass-time.

<blockquote><em>[

From Michael Moore's mailing list came "17 Reasons Not to Slit Your
Wrists": here's 7 of the funniest.

]</em></blockquote>

<p>
1. It is against the law for George W. Bush to run for president again.

<p>
2. Bush's victory was the NARROWEST win for a sitting president since
Woodrow Wilson in 1916.

<p>
3. The only age group in which the majority voted for Kerry was young
adults (Kerry: 54%, Bush: 44%), proving once again that your parents are 
always wrong and you should never listen to them.

<p>
6. Michigan voted for Kerry! So did the entire Northeast, the birthplace of 
our democracy. So did 6 of the 8 Great Lakes States. And the whole West 
Coast! Plus Hawaii. Ok, that's a start. We've got most of the fresh water, 
all of Broadway, and Mt. St. Helens. We can dehydrate them or bury them in 
lava. And no more show tunes!

<p>
8. 88% of Bush's support came from white voters. In 50 years, America will 
no longer have a white majority. Hey, 50 years isn't such a long time! If 
you're ten years old and reading this, your golden years will be truly 
golden and you will be well cared for in your old age.

<p>
9. Gays, thanks to the ballot measures passed on Tuesday, cannot get 
married in 11 new states. Thank God. Just think of all those wedding gifts 
we won't have to buy now.

<p>
12. Admit it: We like the Bush twins and we don't want them to go away.

<h3>Notice of Revocation of Independence</h3>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>

<p>
Totally non-Linux, but I figure that the UK-based folks here should get a
chuckle. As for us on this side of the pond, well, we knew it was all
coming to an end; this last election was a strong indicator. "Not with a
'!' but with a Windsor..." - something like that, right?
<!-- # -->
<!-- #----- Forwarded message from Gene Spafford
&lt;spaf@cerias.purdue.edu&gt; ----- -->

<p>
(penned somewhere in the U.K.)

<p>
Notice of Revocation of Independence

<p>
To the Citizens of the United States of America:

<p>
In the light of your recent failure to elect a reasonable president 
and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the 
revocation of your independence, effective today.

<p>
Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical 
duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except 
Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new Prime Minister (Tony Blair 
for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is 
a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America 
without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will 
be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to 
determine whether any of you noticed.

<p>
To aid to the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the 
following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

<p>
* You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. 
Then look up "aluminium". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be 
amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, 
you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up 
"vocabulary".

<p>
In addition, using the same 27 words interspersed with filler noises 
such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and ineffective 
form of communication. Look up "interspersed".

<p>
* There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know 
on your behalf.

<p>
* You should learn to distinguish between English and Australian 
accents. It really isn't that hard.

<p>
* Hollywood will be required to occasionally cast English actors as 
the good guys.

<p>
* You will no longer be allowed to play American football. There is 
only one kind of football. What you refer to as "football" is not a 
very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world 
outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays 
American football. Instead you should play proper football. 
Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a 
difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed 
to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not 
involve stopping for a rest every 20 seconds or wearing full body 
armour like nancies).

<p>
* You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons 
if they give you any merde. The 97.85% of you who were not aware 
that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves 
lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. (Merde is French 
for "sh*t".)

<p>
* All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for 
your own good. When we show you German Cars, you will understand 
what we mean.

<p>
* Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.

<p>
Thank you for your co-operation.

<h3>More yoga fun</h3>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
<!-- #[cc'd to Mark Seymour, since he'll enjoy the design gaffe] -->
<!-- # -->
I just subscribed to Yoga Journal (one of those "get a free issue and we
get to bother you for a while" deals), and got a "bonus": a pretty little
PDF entitled "Yoga Remedies for Everyday Ailments". The first thing that
caught my eye was the table of contents:
<pre>
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Computer Vision Syndrome
Insomnia
Common Cold
Headache
Stress
Back Pain
Depression
Customer Service

<p>
WHOA! If they discovered relief for Customer Service, those ancient
yogis were some <b>smart</b> cookies!

<p>
As to the cure for "Computer Vision Syndrome" (I know that some of you
were just about to ask): become a Corpse. No, really; Savasana (the
Corpse pose) is what's recommended. I <b>think</b> this is different from
saying "f**k off and die", but it may just have been lost in the

<h3>In Search Of Open-Source Experts</h3>

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
<a
href="http://informationweek.linuxpipeline.com/52600065">http://informationweek.linuxpipeline.com/52600065</a>
Mentions Ballmer's email, and quotes Faber:

<p>
'One of the chief complaints of CIOs and CEOs is that they can't find
enough qualified open-source programmers, says Faber Fedor, an
open-source consultant with services firm Linux NJ.com Inc. "I don't
think there are enough experienced people out there for the demand," he
says. Yankee Group analyst Laura DiDio agrees. "There's a dearth of
skilled Linux administrators, by comparison to the more-mature Windows,
Unix, NetWare, and Macintosh environments," she says. And what happens
when too much demand meets too little supply? "They can command a
premium," DiDio says. "They get a 20% to 30% salary premium in the large
metropolitan markets."'

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
This is a joke, right?  Or an attempt to push the market in a certain
direction by stating what you hope for as if it were a fact?  (As Ben
Okopnik's father Stalin did so well.)  

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Son, not father. You keep telling me I'm an old fart - you just don't
know the extent of it.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I only wish employers were
begging for open-source developers and Linux administrators.  Then I'd
have a lot more choices for jobs.  But most jobs still seem to require
Windows skills, and I turn those down rather than putting the time and
expense into training for them.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
It's not the skills - it's <b>you</b>. They see that geeky Pythoneer look,
the bald head, and the leather jacket, and they <b>run</b> to lock and bar
the doors and windows.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I guess when I stick my tongue out and hiss, it doesn't help.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[laugh] Yesterday, when we were assigned one posture each to teach, the
woman that got Bujangasana, the Cobra, is now known as Sssswami Ssssuzy.
And I got to learn just how vitally important humor is to me in a
learning situation. Good stuff all around.

<p>
I got my least favorite posture, Paschimottanasana (seated forward bend,
A.K.A. "intense stretch of the west [back]"), and discovered a way to at

...and remember, every time you're imprecise in your communication,
somewhere a homeless kitten gets run over by a Mack truck. And it'll all
be your fault.

<p>
<strong>[Brian]</strong>
That's not <u>nearly</u> as guilt inducing as running over the kitten
<b>with</b>
a home, 

<p>

I don't know that running them over with a home would be more painful
than doing it with a Mack truck, but you're welcome to be creative and
report the results.

given not ten minutes ago to the five year old girl standing by
the side of the road, spattered, red, and crying as she fumbles with her
inhaler.

<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I <b>like</b> it! I'm sure you'll soon be getting an email from Upstairs,
thanking you for the idea; the new variation will be implemented ASAP,
and beta testers are urged to apply to the appropriate agency.

Now, that is guilt

Oooh, is that the bobble-head kind? I always wanted one of those; they
work really well on a boat.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
"somewhere"? And what is the truck driver's name? By your own standards,
that sentence probably dispatched at <b>least</b> two kittens.  

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Not at all; I'm being 100% precise to the limit of available data. If I
tried to fill in the empty spaces with invented crap, that would be
<u>less</u> precise - and I don't like hearing kitty-squishing.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
However, if
it makes you feel any better, they might not have been cute.  Or perhaps
they were. If we could <b>observe</b> them being run over, the possible
states would collapse to one. (Curiosity <b>may</b> have killed
Schrodinger's
cat.) 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Schroedinger was WRONG. The cat in his box has a <b>very</b> definite
state:
<u>pissed off.</u> Those who have tried the experiment and opened the box
afterwards have no doubts (they may have large medical bills, but <b>no</b>
doubts.)

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Of course, since we're looking at them being run over by a Mack
truck, this may bias the results slightly towards the "non-cute" side.
We'll have to take that into account.

No, that's not me. B.K.S. Iyengar - seen in the above pics at the age of

as well, at the age of 80. It would probably take a nuke to kill the old

see some really unbelievable postures as well as perfect alignment in
all of them, stop by a book store and take a look at his "Light on

Nah. If I got some electrodes, a Tesla generator, wired you up and
cranked the handle, <b>then</b> I'd expect you to be shocked - and would be
quite disappointed in you if you weren't. As it is, I just expect you to
get into Adho Mukha Shvanasana using Dirgha and Ujjayi Pranayama,

The word that best illustrates the problem here is 'world'; it best
describes the magnitude of the problem. As it happens, I found my
introduction to Unix today -- that is, "AIX for Customer Engineers:
Quick Reference Card" (ZR23-6948-00, if anyone cares  :), which my uncle
gave me one day when he brought my brothers and me to his workplace to
play multiplayer 'Doom' (I don't remember when this was, but I know it
was before Doom 2). From that, I learned a few basic commands.

Just out of curiousity, what does a "Customer Engineer" do? Do they

subject of which we speak secret, more that I tend to get ahead of myself,

<h3>Twisted Update</h3>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>

<p>
I've been installing Gentoo applications at home since Sunday.  Previously
I'd done the basic installation (tarballs, kernel, configuration).  Sunday
I ran "emerge sync" (which updates the list of available builds), "emerge
portage" (which updates the package manager) and "emerge system" (which
updates all the base packages, of which there were only five or six since
the 2004.2 release).  But "emerge xorg-x11" run from Sunday night to
Tuesday, and "emerge kde" started Tuesday night and is still running. (It's
now Thursday morning.)  To be sure, it's installing a lot of
dependencies as well as those packages, including LDAP and Samba which I
don't need.  Still, it took only three nights on my two 1.5 GHz Pentium 4s
at work, and it was finished by morning.  (Actually, some of the nights it
worked only three hours and was done.)  What a difference a 450 MHz AMD
K6-2 Duron makes.  It's a third the speed, but still, it's been compiling
continuously 24 hours for four days.  I've taken two breaks to switch to
my existing Debian for some Firefox websurfing, but that was just a couple
hours each.  Once KDE is on, I have some 35 other applications to install.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Hee hee. I posted a broken version of this on IRC, but here's a working
version. If you're familiar with Debian's vrms, you'll welcome vta (though
obviously it <i>should</i> be in Ruby):

{
    print "&gt; $_";
    if (/java/i)
    {
        print "\nSo much bloat, so little use\n\n";
    }
    elsif (/kde/i)
    {
        print "\nIf I wanted to get rid of my RAM, I'd take it out of the

    }

that's why it's so popular.  It softens things when

I thought it was "that's true &lt;significant pause&gt; NOT!", or did
"Wayne's

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Because he can treat it like a joke.  In Ireland I think you use "would
be" the same way.  "Where would you be goin today?"  "What would... just
supposin..."?

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I usually say: "Where are you going?" if it is a question in the future
tense.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
The usual thing with the more rural types is "I do be hungry by 6 o'clock"; 
I would use the more correct "I'd usually be...", but "I would be..." is 
pretty common.

<p>
<!-- #[Jimmy] -->
English lacks a satisfactory way of expressing the habitual, so we had to 
invent one -- we're creatures of habit  :)  It also lacks a second person 
plural, so we use 'ye'

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Actually, what English lacks is a second person singular.  "You" is really
the second person plural accusative.  thee : thou :: ye : you

<p>
Although down in these here parts, we just say y'all, y'know.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
That's just so direct and Germanic.  :)   Oh wait, the Germanic way would
be
"Where go you?"  But if you get really Gaelic-influenced English speakers
from Ireland, they just seem to go out of their way to avoid certain
simple constructs.  E.g. I once asked a bartender girl in a pub,
    - Do you have pear cider?
    - I have.
Why not just "yes"?  But apparently Gaelic doesn't have words for "yes" or
"no".

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
The closest we have are "is ea"/"'sea" and "ní hea" -- "it is" and "it 
isn't". In general, a yes/no type answer depends on the question, because 
it's generally given as an abbreviation. For example, if I were to ask "An 
bhfuil tú i do chónaí i nDúrlas" 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
And people talk about <b>Perl</b> being unreadable! Whew. On the other
hand,
trying to execute the above will probably decompile the Universe or
something. That's the Irish for you, saving or wrecking civilization
with equal gusto...  :) 

<p>

"St. Patrick's: the one day of the year when the 2% of the world's

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
It seems that Irish is best used when drunk:

<p>
Most people never use it, except for the National Anthem.
The National Anthem is rarely heard outside of nightclubs (at closing 
time), or sporting events.

<p>
You could also make the point that Irish makes heavy use of the few 
syllablic sounds that the drunk can pronounce ('feh', 'nya', 'ooh', 
'oh', 'bah', 'sh', etc.) for a reason.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I'm awed. <b>That's</b> what I call foresight: designing a language around
a
yet-to-be-invented national pastime - at least if I have the timeline
right (and if the concept of "Irish" before alcohol make <u>any</u> sense
whatsoever.) The Russians didn't do nearly as well, with all those
plosives, fricatives, and "soft/hard signs" that can barely be managed
(if at all) by non-native speakers when totally sober.

("Do you live in Thurles", though it literally means something like "Are 
you (habitually) in Thurles"), you would answer "Níl mé" ("I am not"), 
which is short for the full answer, "Níl mé i mo chónaí i nDúrlas"

<p>
There are no real swear words in Irish either. I think the closest is
"baistúin" (bastard). After that, it's relatively mild terms like "idiot".

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Because I like using "I have".

W: Yes, sir?<br>
M: Ah, well, I'll have some of that!<br>
W: Oh, I'm sorry sir, I thought you were referring to me, Mr.
   Wensleydale, that's my name.

<p>
Now I won't get any sleep at all tonight, Spam song running round my
head, dead parrots (next best thing to (best thing next to?) an
unconscious Jimmy Buffett) and no bloody cheese at all. All because
Thomas likes using "I have". Note the approved use of the word like in
the line quoted above. Like, gnarly, dude.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
More confusingly, I often combine it
with yes: "I have, yes". It's done for a reason. Answering a question
with a simple yes or no, leaves no scope for other avenues of
conversation. It can also be looked upon as a non-comittal response.

fonts, which I find misfortunate (I believe you understand the explanation 
telling you about the new modern large monitors). Your arguments makes any 
further effort on my side largely futile -- basicly your position is based 
on the preponderance of users expressing favorable opinion of the current 
design of the gazette. I acquiesce to the majority.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Oh, come on. Don't give up so easily. You know the scene:
<pre>
Salesman  Haggle properly. This isn't worth nineteen!
Brian     You just said it was worth twenty!
Salesman  Oh dear, oh dear. Come on, haggle.
Brian     Oh. All right, I'll give you ten.
Salesman  That's more like it. Ten?! Are you trying to insult me?! Me,
          with a poor dying grandmother, ten?!
Brian     All right, I'll give you eleven.
Salesman  Now  you're  getting  it.  Eleven!!?  Did I hear you right?!
          Eleven?! This cost me twelve, you wanna ruin me?!
Brian     Seventeen?
Salesman  No no no no, seventeen.
Brian     Eighteen!
Salesman  No, no, you go to fourteen now.
Brian     All right, I'll give you fourteen.
Salesman  Fourteen?! Are you joking?!
Brian     That's what you told me to say!

Ten for that you must be mad...

I'd like an argument, please.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Aw, dammit Jay, you picked the wrong time. Normally I'd be happy to oblige, 
but I'm just in too good a mood. Sorry 'bout that. 

<p>
<strong>[Kapil]</strong>
I see no "absolute value" in that. But if you do then take the imaginary
exponent of the argument and multiply by the absolute value----that's
when things start to get complex.  :-) 
 
Sorry. Couldn't prevent this convoluted pun from slipping out.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
The acme of pun acknowledgement (I hesitate to use the term
"approbation"), according to Spider Robinson, is for everyone to hold
their nose and flee screaming into the night. This isn't <b>quite</b> up to
that level, but... whew. What a stinker. Well done, Kapil.  :) 

<p>
A point to consider, of course, is that DOS programs take arguments;
Linux programs use <b>options</b>.  :)  [<a href="#laundrette.ben1">1</a>]

<strong>[Melanie]</strong>
After working in this industry for nearly three days, I would like to
request the idea, that understanding Linux requires a PhD.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. You'd like to "request
the idea"? Do you mean that you'd like to find out if the above
statement is true? If so, the answer is a resounding "no". I've sat
little kids in front of a computer running Linux and seen them dive
right in and do what they wanted right away; ditto people who had only
used Internet Explorer/0utlook/MSWord previously.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Heh. I had an angry (well, more exasperated, truth be told) phone call
from my son's mother yesterday because he went looking up even more
stuff he wants for Christmas behind my back, and has been driving her
nuts about it. I'll have to explain that once the email to Santa goes,
that's it. My point is, he's 7 1/2 and did this without my help; he
knows how to use the menus in a few different window managers, and he
knows how to use the shell to launch commands. He has even found and
used software I'd long forgotten about installing, and there are things
he can do with, say, the Gimp that I can't replicate.

If linuxgazette readers could vote for a redesign of the
site, I would point you at Eric's site for a good example of what I
would aspire to have.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
And I, for one, appreciate the input. The response that we've received
with regard to the redesign has been strongly positive, and it's good to
get at least one dissenting viewpoint; agreement from everyone usually
prompts me to start looking for the tool marks in the plastic.

From an email I received today (not spam, it's somebody with whom I've
actually done business):

----- Forwarded message ----------------------------------------------

*************************************************************
One Week Only - BOGO Savings at Savon and Osco!
(but if you DO miss out on that, at least take advantage of
no cost ground shipping within the US direct from us.)
*************************************************************

What the HECK is a BOGO you ask?  Don't worry, I had no idea either!

BOGO is simply a Buy-One-Get-One (B.O.G.O.) discount from Savon or Osco.

----- Forwarded message ----------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>
Usually, manufacturers just send out the coupons and let you figure out
the bogosity for yourself. I guess these folks decided to short-cut the
process...

<p>
<strong>[Jay]</strong>
My initial reaction was "hey, waitaminnit; aren't you the guy with the
<a href="http://okopnik.freeshell.org/acronyms.cgi">personal 
acronym finder?</a>"... and then I re-read that a couple times. 

<p>
 :-) 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Yeah, that "Forwarded message" line can be hard to spot...  :) 

<p>
<strong>[Jay]</strong>
The Bogon flux connection hadn't ever occurred to me, amusingly enough.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
For me, that "BOGO Savings" line was just perfect. I let the company
know about it so they'd have $CLUE installed in the future, anyway.

I don't mean to offend anyone either, but I've been seeing more than
usual of that sort of traffic lately on TAG (by which I mean responses
which seem a bit overreactive); is it possible that our collective skins
are thinning a bit too much lately?

Subtle? Moi? I'm about as subtle as a .... really unsubtle thing. 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Uh-huh. You keep letting that side of you slip through, and people are
going to start suspecting, and you'll lose the advantage of perceived
innocence. 
<!-- # Innocence? Do I have to say it?  -->
Then you'll have to resort to blue contact lenses and doing
the wide-eyed blink thing, and... well, trust me, it just gets messy.
And nobody buys it, either [injured look].

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Hey, I never pretended to be innocent. Alls I'm saying is I'm not innocent. 
Is that (in itself, not the attendants) a crime? 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I'm really interested in your answer, because I can't fathom
what effect you could be looking for; if you were trying to annoy
people, it would make sense, but it's mystifying otherwise. Sure, the
deal with Tom came down to miscommunication - it happens - but since
there <u>was</u> good will on both sides, there was no harm done. 

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
No, no, no. As Thomas noted, vagueness makes baby Jesus cry. 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
It got handled. Tom clarified, the baby Jesus stopped crying, and no
cute puppies or kittens got mercilessly mangled by large machinery.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Any resemblance to persons or events is entirely possible. No animals or 
religious icons were harmed in the making of this email.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Well, certainly not <b>large</b> machinery. I mean, they're <b>kittens</b>.
You
don't need something large. Right tool for the right job. I mean, you've
heard the expression, "to a man with a hammer, every problem looks like
a small, cute, fuzzy animal?"?  :-) 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I find a cast-iron frying pan to be far more effective. Not only can you
flatten the little bastards, but a little oil and a few spices, and
you've got a start on a good meal. I mean, just <b>look</b> at the prices
on
all that Atkins stuff in the supermarket, consider the amount of protein
running around on the streets, and you'll see the sense in what I'm
saying...

Yeah, raising the

days?) could get pretty wild. I mean, if you get some cute babe excited
about playing with a snake coiled around the base of the spine... dude,
you KNOW the action is going to get serious. There's none of this "that
was nice" and padding off to the kitchen for a glass of water; it's ALL
about the neighbors calling the cops at 3 a.m. due to the unseemly loud
noises, creative use of kitchen appliances, wildly messed-up hair, and
"what the hell is my shoe doing on the chandelier???"

...but grousing
about Open Source software without contributing anything to solve the
problem (<u>educated</u>, pinpoint grousing counts for credit) has annoyed me
personally from the very first time I saw it; that hasn't changed at
all. As for anyone else, you'd have to ask them by name - I don't see
any problem with people showing an edge to keep their valuable time from
being wasted by unproductive engagements. That is, in fact, a highly
valuable skill when coupled with a bit of discretion.

found out yesterday, when I had to spend the day standing in front of a 
freezer :). I have 99% of the range of motion I used to, and I'm 
starting to shake off the tendancy to avoid using it. Better than I was 
told to expect, basically.
