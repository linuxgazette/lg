It says right in the question what to do.  Which part of "using the man page" do
you not understand?

<P> But here's a hint: there is no 'Is' command.  Do you mean 'ls'?  But it has a lot more than

Books.  There is probably a library near you.  Failing 
that the textbook that was suggested by your professor
may have the answer in it, or a bibliography leading

They work just like cellphones, except that they don't eat as much, so 
when they are on their lunch break, they get to hang out by the coffee
for a bit longer.  They like that because they can catch the local buzz.

<P> Honestly, the reason they don't eat as much is usually because the cell
phones regularly "ping" their cell site to make sure they don't have
to negotiate a handoff in order to keep listening, while pagers are
usally passive and they get whatever signal they get.  So they only 
use a tiny amount of juice to remember messages they already recieved,
and to ding or buzz or whatever it is they do.  

<P> Two way pagers may act more like cellphones, and some cellphones are
definitely pagers too, so beyond this, you need to hit the web searching
on the model number.  Some even let you web browse but even there, you 
are still not close to Linux.  See the search engines, using the keyword
"WAP" for more about that stuff.

<P> Try "how pagers work" in google?

<H3 ALIGN="center">The finger and the Internet oracle</H3>

<p align="right"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><strong>Answered By Iron, Nick Moffitt, Heather Stern and Ben Okopnik
</strong></FONT></p>

Anonymous Coward asked:
<STRONG>
I have a question about the "finger" option on telnet.  I know that you can
find out when someone has logged in by entering "finger name" But I was
wondering if it possible to find out who has tried to finger your e-mail
account??
</STRONG></P>


<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Iron]
The short answer: 

<P> If you are the sysadmin, you can run "fingerd" with the "-l" option to
log incoming requests; see "man fingerd".  Otherwise, if you have Unix
progamming experience, it *may* be possible to write a script that logs
information about the requests you get.  If you're merely concerned
about security, the correct answer is to turn off the "fingerd" daemon
or read the "finger" and "fingerd" manpages to learn how to limit what
information your computer is revealing about you and about itself.
However, you have some misconceptions about the nature of "finger" which
we should also address.

<P> The long answer:

<P> "finger" and "telnet" are two distinct Internet services.  "http" (WWW)
and "smtp" (sending e-mail) are two other Internet services.  Each
service is completely independent of the others.  

<P> Depending on the command-line options given and the cooperation of the
remote site, "finger user@host" may tell you: 

<P> (1) BASIC USER INFORMATION: the user's login name, real name,
terminal name and write status, idle time, login time, office location and
office phone number. 

<P> (2) EXTENDED USER INFORMATION: home directory, home phone number, login
shell, mail status (whether they have any mail or any unread mail), and the
contents of their "~/.plan" and "~/.project" and "~/.forward" files.

<P> (3) SERVER INFORMATION: a  ``Welcome to ...'' banner which also shows some
informations (e.g. uptime, operat­ing system name and release)--similar to what
the "uname -a" and "uptime" commands reveal on the remote system.

<P> Normally, ".plan", ".project" and ".forward" are regular text files.
".plan" is normally a note about your general work, ".project" is a note
about the status of your current project(s), and ".forward" shows
whether your incoming mail is being forwarded somewhere else or whether
you're using a mail filter (it also shows where it's being forwarded to
and what your mail filter program is, scary).

<P> I've heard it's possible to make one of these files a named pipe
connected to a script.  I'm not exactly sure how it's done.  (Other TAG
members, please help.)  You use  "mkfifo" or "mknod -p" to create the
special file, then somehow have a script running whose standard output
is redirected to the file.  Supposedly, whenever "finger" tries to read
the file, it will read your script's output.  But I don't know how your
script would avoid a "broken pipe" error if it writes when there's
nobody to read it, how it would know when there's a reader, or how the
reader would pass identifying information to the script.  Each Internet
connection reveal's the requestor's IP, and if the remote machine is
running the "identd" daemon, one can find out the username.  But how
your "finger" script would access that information, I don't know, since
it's not running as a subprocess of "finger", so there's no way for
"finger" to pass it the information in environment variables or
command-line arguments.  

<P> However, "finger" is much less useful nowadays than it was ten years
ago.  Part of this is due to security paranoia and part to the fact
that we use servers differently nowadays.

<P> (1) Re security, many sysadmins have rightly concluded that "finger" is a
big security risk and have disabled "fingerd" on their servers, or enable it
only for intranet requests (which are supposedly more trustworthy).  Not only
is the host information useful to crackerz and script kiddiez, but users may
not realize how much information their revealing.

<P> (2) Re how we use servers, in 1991 at my university, we had one Unix
computer (Sequent/Dynix) that any student could get an account on.
Users were logged in directly from hardwired text terminals, dialup or
telnet.  You could use "finger" to see whether your friends were logged
in.  Since you knew where your friends normally logged in from, you had
a fair idea where they were at the moment and could meet them to hack
side-by-side with them or to read (Usenet) news or to play games
together.  (Actually, you didn't even need to use "finger".  "tcsh" and
"zsh" would automatically tell you when certain "watched" users logged
in and out.) You could even use "w" to find out which interactive
program they were currently running.  But soon demand went above 350
simultaneous users, especially when the university decided to promote
universal e-mail use among its 35,000 students and 15,000 staff.  The
server was replaced by a cluster of servers, and every user logging in
to the virtual host was automatically placed on one of the servers at
random.  Since "finger" and "w" information--as well as the tcsh/zsh
"watch" service--are specific to a certain server, it was a pain to
check all the servers to see if your friends were on any of them.  About
this time, people started using X-windows, and each "xterm" window would
show up in "finger" as a separate logged-in user.  Also, finger access
became disabled outside the intranet.  "finger" became a lot less
convenient, so it fell into disuse.

<P> (3) "finger" only monitors login sessions.  This includes the "login"
program, "telnet", "xterm", "ssh" (and its insecure cousins "rsh" and
"rlogin").  It does not include web browsing, POP mail reading, irc or
interactive chat, or instant messaging.  These servers *could* write
login entries, but they don't.  Most users coming from the 
web-browser-IS-my-shell background never log in, wouldn't know what to
do at the shell prompt if they did log in, don't think they're missing
anything, and their ISPs probably don't even have shell access anyway.
That was the last nail in the coffin for "finger".

<P> So in short, "finger" still works, but its usefulness is debatable.
Linus used to use his ".plan" file to inform people of the current
version of Linux and where to download it.  SSC used to use it to
propagte its public PGP key.  There are a thousand other kinds of 
useful information it could be used for.  However, now that everybody
and his dog has a home page, this ".plan" information can just as easily
be put on the home page, and it's just as easy (or easier for some
people) to access it via the web than via "finger".


<P> <EM>Nick Moffitt asks another question, and somehow these two threads
tie together.  Then one of the Gang (whose name fell off this message)
suggested:</EM>

<P>

Iron asked:
<STRONG>
Yes, but *why* is this assbackwards architecture by far the most popular
computer on the market?  BECAUSE of the backwards compatibility.

Yes, but "backward compatibility" does not have to mean "keeping every 
single piece of old garbage". Once we reached the 
processing power of 486DX100s, emulating DOS for complete backward 
compatibility was a real option - and redesigning the architecture from 
the ground up while still maintaining backward compatibility was a 
reasonable goal. That was, erm, a few years ago.

Which sends it to the great bit bucket in the sky, where it belongs.
Remove the extra spaces in the middle of the sentances.  They are just
to keep <I>LJ</I> from being deleted by any overzealous spamfilter.
The second text line is a Spanish version we also received.  Of course,
since most of the Gang doesn't read mail on Windows, we didn't have to
worry about damage, just about the amount of disk space those buggers
take up.  Sir Can attaches a file to the message.  It's a different file
each time, but usually at least 200 KB.  That means five of them take up
an entire megabyte.  LG's spamfile this month was a whopping

<P> Listen, you don't have to tell me - I KNOW what your experiences 
have been marketing online. You've been in one of two places. EITHER 
you're fairly new on the Internet, and you KNOW that SOMEBODY 
makes money online - but you can't quite figure out HOW. OR MAYBE 
you can "sign people up" like gangbusters - and those people just 
SIT THERE. Those people don't just "sit there" because they are "lazy",
 "stupid" or "don't have the desire". The ONLY way for this to work is 
to do what is done in EVERY OTHER industry but ours - and that is, 
let the "marketers" do the "marketing" - and let the other people do 
what THEY do best!

<P>
 Some people just STINK at marketing. And they will NEVER
make money online -no matter which "HOT! NEW!" thing they jump
into again THIS week! But the thing is - you don't HAVE to! Want to 
find out why I market for OTHER PEOPLE all day? Then you 
need to see my open letter about HOW we do that. Just a word to the 
wise. LOTS of people do it our way. Want to FINALLY make money 
online? Want to NEVER have to "recruit" and "motivate" and "babysit" 
again? Then see how YOU can succeed online even if you HATE to 
market! WHY IN THE WORLD would you NOT want us to do the 
marketing FOR you? Are you having such GREAT success trying to 
do it on your own? Are your people? Let US set up a totally 
AUTOMATED system for you where WE do all the marketing for 
you and we ALL make money!!
