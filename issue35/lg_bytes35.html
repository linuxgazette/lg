O'Reilly Announces Open Source Conferences
</font>
</H3>
<P>
SEBASTOPOL, CA--O'Reilly & Associates announced today that it is
expanding its support of Open Source software by presenting the
O'Reilly Open Source Conferences--Perl Conference 3.0 plus several new
technical Conferences on mission-critical Open Source software--on
August 21-24, 1999 at the Monterey Convention Center in Monterey, CA.
<P>
For the first time, programmers, webmasters, and system administrators
can find--under one roof--a spectrum of high-end technical sessions,
presented by the key developers in each technology. In real-world
applications, users draw on several Open Source technologies to get the
job done. At the O'Reilly Conferences on Perl, Linux, FreeBSD, Apache,
Sendmail and other Open Source technologies, attendees can move freely
between Conferences, choosing from a rich panoply of sessions on these
interrelated technologies.  In addition, each Conference is preceded by
in-depth tutorials.
<P>
<I>Linux Journal</I> is a major sponsor of O'Reilly's Linux Conference.
Publisher Phil Hughes said, "Since the early days, O'Reilly has been
documenting Linux and the Open Source utilities that Linux users depend
on. They're very close to the technical community, and they'll bring
that inside perspective to their Linux Conference. We're looking
forward to working with them."

Linux wins PC World Denmark award for "Innovation of the Year - Software"
Copenhagen, 1998-11-12<BR> 
<P>
On behalf of the entire Linux community, the Sk&aring;ne Sj&aelig;lland Linux User
Group (SSLUG) today received the PC World Denmark 'Product of the
Year' award in the category "Innovation of the Year - Software". The
award was accepted by Peter Toft and Henrik St&oslash;rner from SSLUG.
<P>
The "Innovation of the Year" award is given to products or
technologies which have shown significant innovativeness and impact
through out the year. PC World editors motivated their choice thus:
<P>
"Linux. The 'Ugly Duckling' that turned into a beautiful swan and
became - to put it briefly - the most widely used operating system for
Internet servers world wide, despite the marketing muscle of the larger
companies. NT has a tremendous hold on the market, but Linux is
gaining new followers every day, and continues to find new uses
wherever a stable, economical and versatile operating system is
needed."
<P>
The other two nominees in the "Innovation of the Year - Software"
category were<BR> 
* Microsoft Windows 98<BR> 
* Mirabilis ICQ

ISVs -- please join the LSB effort
</font>
</H3>
<P>
With the Linux standardization well on its way with the Linux Standard Base
(LSB) effort headed by Daniel Quinlan, various vendors brought up the
issue that there needed to be a way for independent software vendors to
get their input into the standards effort.   After some discussion,
it was decided to add a mailing list to the LSB effort that was specifically
for ISVs.
<P>
This list will make it possible for ISVs to hash out what they see needed
in the Linux standard and then present their joint effort to the LSB group for
consideration.  This approach will make it easier for LSB to meet the
needs of all the vendors.
<P>
If you are an ISV and want to join the list, send your e-mail address to
Clarica Grove (<A HREF="mailto:clarica@ssc.com">clarica@ssc.com</A>) with ISV in the subject line of your message.
She will add you to the list and we can get our part of the effort
underway.  If it is unlikely we are familiar with the product you have
developed, please include a brief description.

Linux Game Development Center
</font>
</H3>
<P>
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 1998 09:39:14 GMT<BR> 
   Linux has games. Linux has good games. But that other operating system
   has several orders of magnitude more good games than Linux. That's
   bad. And difficult to overcome, as it's not only because of technical
   reasons. But we, the free software community, have have a long history
   of solving problems and shipping around obstacles. There is no reason
   why we should not be able to solve this issue, too.
<P>
   In essence we are suggesting that this new Linux Game Development
   Center be a kind of meta-project. It would be dedicated to advocating
   Linux as gaming platform, collecting knowledge about Linux game
   development and using it to help all interested people, providing
   facilities for discussion to Linux game developers and, last but not
   least, encouraging and helping existing free (Open Source) game SDK
   projects coordinate with one another.
<P>
   This is also a call for developers, users and game SDK projects to
   join our efforts.
<P>
   While game development for Linux would be an important goal of the web
   site, the most important goal would be the development of quality
   cross-platform game libraries. For that reason, developers of games
   and game SDKs for platforms other than Linux would be more than
   welcome to join us. Especially if they are interested in porting
   software to or from Linux.
<P>
   The biggest problem with having multiple, competing projects is the
   resultant (developer and user) confusion. What we are proposing is a
   Linux Game Development Center that is aimed simply at reducing that
   confusion by helping people to find, evaluate, combine and use the
   available tools, or to develop new, missing ones.

KDE on Corel's Netwinder
</font>
</H3>
<P>
Ottawa, Canada--November 25, 1998<BR> 
Corel Computer and the KDE project today announced a technology relationship
that will bring the K Desktop Environment (KDE), a sophisticated graphical
user environment for Linux and UNIX, to future desktop versions of the
NetWinder family of Linux-based thin-clients and thin-servers. A graphical
user interface is a necessary element for Corel Computer to create a family of
highly reliable, easy-to-use, easy-to-manage desktop computers. The alliance
between Corel Computer and KDE, a non-commercial association of Open Source
programmers, provides NetWinder users a sophisticated front-end to Linux,
a stable and robust Unix-like operating system.
<P>
Corel Computer has shipped a number of NetWinder DM, or development
machines, to KDE developers who are helping to port the desktop environment.
Corel Computer plans to announce the availability of desktop versions of the
NetWinder running KDE beginning in early 1999. Early demonstrations of
the port, such as the one shown at the Open Systems fair in Wiesbaden,
Germany, in September, have been enthusiastically received by potential
customers.
<P>
As a developing partner, Corel
Computer will release its work back to the KDE development community.

server  install.  All of the power of the Red Hat Linux OS is still available 
via "custom" install.  Back buttons DHCP, boot   floppy creation, enhanced 
rescue mode and countless other tools that made 5.1  a success are all still 
there.

CORBA on LINUX Gains Momentum
<P>
Date: Tue, 03 Nov 1998 16:24:32 -0500<BR> 
Framingham, MA - Programmers and end-users can now obtain implementations
of the Object Management Group's (OMG's) Common Object Request Broker
Architecture (CORBA) for Linux. As the momentum has grown behind the open
source Linux operating system, more and more OMG members have requested
this support. The emergence of CORBA-conformant ORBs for Linux is an
indicator of the commercial confidence and industry support for both CORBA
and Linux.
<P>
At Washington University, the development of the TAO ORB is being sponsored
by companies and organizations including Boeing, Lucent and Motorola which
recognize the value of open source models and can recognize the future
commercial value of such ORBs.

<P>
Date: Wed, 04 Nov 1998 14:56:52 -0500<BR> 
Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 'Slink' is now in a frozen state.  The delay was due to 
the need to stabilize some key packages in the distribution.  The release of 
Slink is scheduled for December 1998.
<P>
Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 'Potato' will be the next version of the Debian 
distribution.  The name is taken from the character 'Mr. Potato Head' in the

mcl 0.42.05 - MUD Client for Linux
</font>
</H3>
<P>
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 1998 08:50:18 GMT<BR> 
mcl is a small MUD client running under a Virtual Console in Linux. It
uses direct VC access via the /dev/vcsa devices, spending very little
CPU time (compared to tintin). This, however, allows it only to be run
under Linux and only under a virtual console.
<P>
New in version 0.42.05 is a number of bug fixes (actions not saving,
speedwalk acting incorrectly in some situation and more) as well as
support for compression of the connection (using zlib). The latter is
currently only supported by Abandoned Reality (abandoned.org 4444) but
we hope to have the server-side code for any MERC-derived MUD available
soon.

Dlite v0.03 -- Debian Lite distributon

<P>
Date: Wed, 18 Nov 1998 13:07:25 GMT<BR> 
Dlite v0.03 is small sub-set of the Debian GNU/Linux binary packages
most suited to ISPs needing a small but powerful operating system.
The distribution will always be less than 100 Mb so it's possible
to maintain a mirror on every host ready for any situation, from
emergency rebuild through to regular maintenance updates.
<P>
A singular sub-set of packages cannot be all things to all people
but by having one consistent base-line reference of the most
commonly used packages readily available and widely used, therefore
tested, it can assist smaller startup Linux based ISP tech people
to get on with managing their clients rather than just the system.

This is a fledgling project so any suggestion are most welcome.

Partitionless Installation with EasyLinux

</H3>
<P>
Date: Wed, 18 Nov 1998 14:20:31 GMT<BR> 
EasyLinux is a revolutionary new Linux distribution which eliminates the
need to repartition hard drives.  Instead, it creates a Linux filesystem
inside a large file on the DOS partition.  Unlike with umsdos,
performance is not significantly affected so this mode of operation is
suitable for production machines.  It is still possible to repartition
if you want to.
<P>
EasyLinux is available in two packages.  The first contains only the two
CDs, and is intended for experienced Linux users.  This package costs £
4.95 (approximately $8).  The second contains the CDs and a 700 page
book about installing and using Linux.  This package also includes
technical support.  The price of this package is £ 29.95 (approximately
$50).

It's a boot/root rescue/emergency floppy image with more stuff than can fit.
Bzip2, 1722Mb formatting, and tight compilation options helped jam a lot on.

It is useful for "learn unix on a floppy" as it runs from ramdisk, includes
the man-pages for everything, and behaves in a generally predictable way.

"The most Linux on one floppy."  (distribution or panic disk).
		1.72MB boot/root rescue disk with a lot of hardware and tools.
		Supports ide, scsi, tape, network adaptors, PCMCIA, much more.
		About 100 utility programs and tools for fixing and restoring.
		See tomsrtbt.FAQ for a list of stuff that is included.  Not a
		script, just the diskette image packed up chock full of stuff.
		Easy to customize startup and scripts for complete rebuilding.
		Also good as learn-unix-on-a-floppy as it has mostly what you
		expect- vi, emacs, awk, sed, sh, manpages- loaded on ramdisks.
		There is one installer that runs under Linux, another for DOS.

(or any Linux box, that's just what I'm using)

As it is brand new, it is also mostly empty, feel free to put any new
listings on it that you want except no porno stuff.  Nothing can be seen
until it is approved, I will check several times a day for stuff needing
approval.
<P>
I would like a lot of Linux related stuff, would like it to sort of
become a specialty search engine for Linux stuff.  But most any listings
are welcome.
<P>
If you want to add a series of new categories, email me and I can add
them all at once.
<P>
This version is BATA and will no doubt evolve a great deal in time to
come.

For any one how wants to run a search engine, lse is available for free

Find it on  the lse!

Yard 1.17 -- creates custom rescue/boot disks
</font>
</H3>
<P>
Date: Mon, 23 Nov 1998 20:51:48 GMT<BR> 
Yard is a suite of Perl scripts for creating rescue disks (also called
bootdisks).  A rescue disk is a self-contained Linux kernel and filesystem
on a floppy, usually used when you can't (or don't want to) boot off your
hard disk.  A rescue disk usually contains utilities for diagnosing and
manipulating hard disks and filesystems.

Macsyma math software for Linux
</font>
</H3>
<P>
ARLINGTON, MA (November 11, 1998):  Macsyma(R) math software is now 
available for the first time in PCs running the Linux operating system.
<P>
Macsyma includes 1,300 executable demonstrations and is
  easily accessible at many points in the help system. Also hypertext
  descriptions of 2,900 topics, a browser with 900 topics and commands,
  and 900 type-in command templates.
<P>
Macsyma 421 has client-server capability, which is particularly 
  helpful on local area networks. 
<P>
Recent mathematical improvements include enhanced speed in solving 
  linear and algebraic equations, stochastic mathematics, better 
  evaluation of special functions, and enhanced tensor analysis. It is 
  smarter about using the algebraic signs of expressions to simplify 
  results.
<P>
The U.S. commercial price for Macsyma 421 for Linux workstations is $249
(or $199 without paper manuals). The U.S. commercial price for Linux 
Macsyma with NumKit (which requires using a client running MS-Windows)
is $349. Academic prices are available.

Buildkernel 0.87 - automates the task of building a Linux kernel
</font>
</H3>
<P> 
Date: Mon, 23 Nov 1998 21:23:23 GMT<BR> 
	Buildkernel is a shell script that automates the task of building
a Linux kernel.  If you can type "buildkernel --NEWESTSTABLE", you can
have a new Linux kernel on your system!  
<P>
	Building a kernel is a complicated task for the new user.  The
Kernel-HOWTO is an excellent summary of how it's done, but it still takes
some time and understanding to do.  Buildkernel takes away a lot of the
learning necessary for first time builders.  For experienced users that
build kernels frequently, if automates the process so it is more
"hands-off".
	It has been tested on the x86 architecture and currently knows
about lilo and boot floppies (I would like to have future releases handle
syslinux, milo, silo, etc. - any takers?).

groovit - making groovy and accurate sound/noise.

<P> 
Date: Sat, 28 Nov 1998 11:48:28 GMT<BR> 
        This application needs testers :<BR> 
        A linux all-in-a-box drum-machine.
<P>
        Groovit is essentially a drum matrix which can handle
        any samples, combined with, at least and depending on
        the CPU strength, two analog synths voices. 
  <P> 
        Any voice can go through several effects, (for instance
        a dynamic filter, and an echo/reverb). It is intended to
        be as "real-time" as possible, depending on CPU strength
        mostly. 
  <P> 
        It computes sounds internally with 32bit range, and
        outputs at 16. It also has several resonant filters that
        quickly bring you handsome noise.

Remote Microscope software 1.0a1 - remote access to optical microscopes
</font>
</H3>
<P>
Date: Sat, 28 Nov 1998 12:10:57 GMT<BR> 
Version 1.0alpha1 of CNRI's Remote Microscope software is now
available.  The Remote Microscope system allows users to access and
control an optical microscope over the Internet using a Java applet,
as demonstrated at the recent Python conference.
<P>
As part of the MEMS Exchange project, CNRI is working on fully
automated and remotely controllable semiconductor inspection
microscopes to let chip designers view their wafers from any location
having an Internet connection.  However, Internet microscope access
can be useful in other fields, such as biology or material science.
We're releasing the code for our microscope software in the hope that
other people will find it useful and will contribute suggestions,
improvements, ports to new systems, etc.

<P>
Date: Sat, 28 Nov 1998 12:41:44 GMT<BR> 
The XFree86 Project, Inc., is proud to announce its latest release,
XFree86-3.3.3.
This is the latest in our series of "final XFree86-3.3.x release" 
Most of our work is focused on XFree86-4.0 these days, but the amazing
shelftime of graphics hardware makes another "old design" release
necessary.
