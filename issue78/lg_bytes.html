<FONT COLOR="green">CBDTPA
</FONT>
</H3> 
The 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">
Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
has published the 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/EFFector/HTML/effect15.11.html#VI">
results</a>
of their "Alphabet Soup Contest" to find more meaningful interpretations of
acronyms like CBDTPA.  Among the 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/EFFector/HTML/effect15.11.html#VI">
winners</a>
was Steven Cherry with the insightful translation: "Consume, But Don't Try
Programming Anything" which very succinctly sums up what many would see as
the spirit behind this legislation.  Unsurprisingly, initiatives like the
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/SSSCA_CBDTPA/20020321_s2048_cbdtpa_bill.pdf">
CBDTPA</a>
and groupings such as the
<a href="http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/">
BPDG</a> [EFF link] (Broadcast Protection Discussion Group) have met with
substantial popular opposition.  
<a href="http://rtnews.globetechnology.com/servlet/RTGAMArticleHTMLTemplate/C/20020410/gt?tf=tgam%252Frealtime%252Ffullstory_Tech.html&cf=globetechnology/tech-config-neutral&slug=gt&date=20020410&archive=RTGAM&site=Technology">
globetechnology.com reported</a>
Judiciary Committee spokeswoman Mimi Devin as saying that not one email in
support of the bill had been received.  This would seem to indicate that
the only people who can benefit from the bill are those who helped draw it
up.  Additionally, a number of websites (such as
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">
EFF</a>
and
<a href="http://digitalconsumer.org/">
DigitalConsumer.org</a>) have served as rallying points for those opposed
to the introduction of these laws, and it is very difficult to find any
pro-CBDTPA online presence outside of corporate webpages.  A recent
<a href="http://linuxandmain.com/essay/craymond.html">
article</a>
by Catherine Olanich Raymond provides a reasoned and legally informed
analysis of the principles behind this broad opposition.

<FONT COLOR="green">DMCA
</FONT>
</H3> 
Although the DMCA is very detrimental to consumers, it should not be
forgotten that it poses serious risks to scientific research also.  This
was seen clearly in the case of
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Emulation/Blizzard_v_bnetd/20020408_eff_bnetd_pr.html">
Edward Felten vs the RIAA</a>.
A reminder was provided by the IEEE's decision to require researchers
submitting journal papers to
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/04/14/166232&mode=thread">
guarantee that the work</a>
did not violate the DMCA.
As 
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">
New Scientist</a>
later
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992169">
reported</a>, this decision was reversed due to popular opposition.
However, as
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/04/17/1649201.shtml?tid=167">
pointed out</a> on Slashdot, it is regrettable that the reversal was based
on complaints rather than on legal arguments or rights.  This is a positive
development, but hardly a vindication of scientific freedoms.

<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/text/134438173_passport18.html">
The Seattle Times reported</a>
that the US federal government is considering the use of Microsoft's
Passport technology to verify the online identity of American citizens.
This would allow citizens to authenticate themselves at government websites
where they might deal with such business as paying taxes or learning about
their entitlements.  This would obviously be an incredible coup for
Microsoft, who 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/24923.html">
The Register reports</a>,
have been pushing hard for popular adoption of Passport technology.  It
also forms part of a broad plan to persuade governments to base their IT
infrastructure around Microsoft products.  This has had 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24882.html">
significant success</a>
in the United Kingdom.

Slashdot links:
<LI> Does Senator Hollings have his good side after all?  
<a href="http://slashdot.org/yro/02/04/19/1551240.shtml?tid%103">Early reports</A>
of his net privacy bill seemed to suggest so, but
<A
HREF="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/04/26/hollings_spyware/index.html">a
later Salon article</A> thinks it's just business as usual: make a bil that pretends
to safeguard people's privacy, but actually gives it to the marketers on a platter.
Not your "sensitive" information (medical history, race, religion, political
affiliation, etc), but your "nonsensitive" information--which includes your name,
address, and anything you buy over the Internet.  Fortunately for the marketers,
this "nonsensitive" information is precisely what they want.  Unfortunately for
individual privacy, one can make a fairly good guess what your medical history,
race, religion and political affiliation is just by analyzing what you buy and
which web pages you read.  So, is there anything good about this bill after all?
At press time, it's too early to say.

<LI> Microsoft FUD notwithstanding, the SAMBA team is 
<A HREF="http://us1.samba.org/samba/ms_license.html">not affected</A> by a
recent MS licence on a technical document related to the CIFS protocol (the license
forbids the information from being used in GPL code) and two patents related to
the CIFS protocol, because SAMBA doesn't use that implementation anyway.

<FONT COLOR="green">CylantSecure
</FONT>
</H3> 
<p>
CylantSecure is an intrusion detection system for Linux and other Unix
variants that stops attacks before they occur by monitoring the behavior of
the operating system.  It has been developed and produced by 
<a href="http://www.cylant.com">
Cylant</a>,
a division of Software Systems International.  By adding instrumentation to
the kernel, Cylant is enabled to benchmark server behavior patterns and
detect changes in those patterns during operation. If an abnormal behavior
occurs, it can be stopped in real time, preventing attacks before they are
executed.
<P> This technique is based on the principle that most attacks change the
behavior of the software being exploited in a measurable way. CylantSecure
uses sensors to monitor the behavior of the software, along with a
statistical analysis engine to identify any abnormalities in the behavior.
Through continuous behavioral monitoring, CylantSecure can send
administrators early warning of attacks, so appropriate measures can be
taken. Such measures might include shutting down the program, shunning
traffic from the attacking IP or performing system state analysis.
