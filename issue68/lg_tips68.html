<P><STRONG>
I am trying to help out my friend use his Inspiron 3800.  He wants to
display what is on his laptop onto the television to watch his dvd movies.
However, now that he has win2k on the laptop he cannot seem to get the fn+f5
button function to work.  This should be very simple.  Connect the s-video
to the t.v., and then push the button.  But it isn't working, and I cannot
get Dell help since it is not my laptop.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Ben sent him a cheerfully silly note expressing that this is not the right

<P>
Just as a possibly helpful aside, I've spoken to Dell tech support 20
times or more, never as an owner. I always start out the conversation
with "Hi, this is Ben Okopnik, and I'm the tech working on Mr. X's
machine." As long as you have the serial numbers, etc. that they're
asking for, there shouldn't be a problem; ask to speak to a supervisor
if there is one. There's absolutely no reason for them to deny you help,
especially if your friend is there with you.

Hi there,
I am trying to do an upgrade on a working RH6.2 system, trying to upgrade
to RH7.1 by using the netboot.img (Install via FTP/HTTP/NFS),
when I get to the question "do you have a driver disk"
I insert the driver disk, but the drivers listed do not have the 3com 3c509
nic card listed
they all seem to be PCI nic cards.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
How can I create a new driver disk for the 3c509 ISA card?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hi Rick --
</P>
<P>
See the README file from the RedHat CD. It points you to an additional
drivers.img file that you use to make another floppy. I'd guess that
the 3C509 driver is there.

<br>Tip From: Jim Dennis (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">The Answer Gang</a>)

<!-- ::
Maximum Username Limits in <TT>/etc/passwd</TT>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:: -->
<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'd like to know how long is the account field in the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file
and if it can be modified: I'm trying to install a system that will
serve users distinguished with their registration code (14 chars or
more) instead  of their usual user name.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any tip is welcome.
TIA.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Jose Antonio.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Under any reasonably recent Linux distribution (any glibc based one)
you can have usernames of up to 31 characters.  I think you're
still required to have an initial alphabetic and I'd be very dubious
of any effort to use any characters other than alphanumerics and
maybe underscores.
</P>
<P>
However, I think the software that you're talking about is
bizarre in this requirement --- and I suspect that it's a severely
broken model that would lead UNIX software to impose constraints
on usernames beyond those implicit in the standard libraries.
</P>
<P>
BTW: Limitations on username lengths and similar issues are purely
a library and userspace issue.  The kernel has no notion of usernames.
UID limits are primarily a kernel issue; although the libraries
naturally must implement to the kernel's requirements.  Linux kernels
prior to 2.4 used a 16-bit UID (limits us to 65,536 distinct users).
In 2.4 this has been changed to a 32-bit value allowing us to use
upto 4-billion UIDs.  Although its a rare system that needs to provide
access to more than 64K users --- there are fairly common administrative
requirements that UIDs be unique throughout the life of a company or
organization -- that they never be re-used or that they be retained for
seven years or whatever.
</P>
<P>
I realize that UID limits weren't part of your question; but they're
likely to be of interest to other readers, especially others who are
come across this in the search engines.
</P>

Folks,

<P>
I enjoy your column and invariably learn something from reading it, but
this time I can answer a question of yours!
</P>
<P>
In your answer to the "LINUX FOR THE PRODUCTION ENVIROMENT" question in
the June issue you asked what sql-ledger is.  It's an accounting package
written in perl.  It uses a relational database back-end (postgres,
maybe others) and the UI is cgi-scripts.  It's pretty good; I used it
last year when I was consulting to cut and track some invoices.  I'm not
an accountant but it seemed to work just fine for me, and it wasn't that
hard to figure out.

HI guys..
I formatted my machine and got rid of windows98 but
when i boot up i get to the command grub&gt; i'm a new
user with some undestanding of linux and windws.
i found this posted i tried this peice of code
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>

<code><strong><font color="#000033"><br>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1

<P><STRONG>
and it said Error: unrecognised command

<P><STRONG>
guys i need to install windows again for some project
work so could u kindly tell me what i should type in
the grub&gt; so that i can do the normal fdisk with a
bootable floppy of win98/95
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks.!!
</STRONG></P>
<P>
This should be no problem,
</P>
<P>
this GRUB thing is the bootmanager installed by your linux distro,
grub is not linux, so it can not regonise the dd command.
Since you allready got rid of Linux 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":-(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> the only thinbg left is to
remove the bootmanager. The dd command would be the right one if you
were still using Linux.
</P>
<P>
Now, for the solution:
</P>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>-Take the win9X floppy,
<li>-boot from this floppy,
<li>-type: fdisk /mbr
<li>-repartition with fdisk (dont forget to keep 2 Gig for Linux (do not
<br>  partion this explicidly, just leave it unused) in an   extended
<br>  partition in case you want to try linux again)
<li>-install M$ Windows...
<li>-get your projekt done
<li>-get Linux back on your PC (we are a Linux List, I have to say this :-)

If you have an 'older' version of a linux distro, it probably hasnt got

<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
I am wondering if there is a way using CGI/Perl or C
to create a program that learns and mimics the packets
sent by programs like realplayer etc, and then be able
to modify the packets so that information like
destination, who sent it etc. I have read a lot on
packet swtiching, bridge proxies etc and I have no
idea on what to do.....

<P>
The first thing you want to learn is a packet sniffer, such as
ethereal:

<P><DL><DT>
or tcpdump:
<DD><A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org"
	>http://www.tcpdump.org</A>
</DL></P>
<P>
That should give you some idea of what the proprietary application is
sending over the wire. Next, you'll want to experiment with mimicking
it.  You can get the information you need to do this from the
excellent "Unix Network Programming" volume 1, by W. Richard Stevens.
(It's C-centric, but you can apply the ideas to other programming
languages too.)

not only do i want to have a central logserver, i also want to find a

events. what should i do?
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P>
syslogd supports writing to a named pipe.  See man syslog.conf.  So,
you could write a script to read from the named pipe and do inserts
into the database.
</P>
<P>
If something bad happens to the database, you'll still want regular logs
to fall back on, so you should log the important stuff to files too.

It sounds like you want a script to automatically log into one place.
There are a few possibilities:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
1) The 'expect' program allows a script to wait for certain characters
from the host (e.g., "ogin:" or "ssword:") and then send the specified
text.  That's usually used for programs that want the entire session
under program control.  Whether you can use 'expect' to log in and then
switch to interactive mode, I don't know.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
2) If you use ssh instead of telnet, you can set up your account on
'host' so that it will allow you to log into it without having to type
a password.  See "man ssh".

Boot with a DOS floppy that has "debug" on it; run
"debug". At the '-' prompt, "block-fill" a 512-byte
chunk of memory with zeroes:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>f 9000:0 200 0
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Start assembly mode with the 'a' command, and enter
the following code:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>mov dx,9000
<br>mov es,dx
<br>xor bx,bx
<br>mov cx,0001
<br>mov dx,0080
<br>mov ax,0301
<br>int 13
<br>int 20
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Press &lt;Enter&gt; to exit assembly mode, take a deep
breath - and press "g" to execute, then "q" to quit
"debug". Your HD is now in a virgin state, and ready
for partitioning and installation.
</P>

<br>QUestion From: Francois
<BR>Tip From: Daniel S. Washko (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">The Answer Gang</a>)

<P><STRONG>
Hi
I am currently running MS Frontpage98 Server extension Redhat Linux 6.0
(<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>) I would like to know if it is possible to run ASP on the same
configuration. Would it be a Frontpage Upgrade or would it be on the
Linux Side  and is it major changes?. Any help would be highly
appreciated.
Thanx
</STRONG></P>

</STRONG></P>
<P>
You should be able to build apache with both Frontpage98 and ASP, but you
will need to add mod_perl first.  Check out this site:

BIND sucks, and we all know it, even though it is a core piece of
infrastructure to the 'net. Bind 9 looks good, but I don't quite yet
feel ready to deploy it. Instead, run BIND in a chroot jail - so even
if it gets hacked, they don't "get" anything.

There's a howto at linuxdoc.org:

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Thanks Ben, and for your thoughts on the learning curve of Windows vs.
UNIX type systems, posted in the Mailbag this month.  Just about any
dangerous daemon might be a tiny bit safer in a chroot jail.  It's not
a perfect trap without some use of the 'capabilities' (privileges really)
in newer kernels, but it's pretty good.

I hope that you can help me find a solution before I'm forced back to NT. I
have to find a Linux solution that will allow me to connect to an Exchange
server over the WAN and then sync address books.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any suggestions?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Well, we've had numerous past articles address the matter of <EM>replacing</EM>
an Exchange server with a Linux box, but you're asking about being
a <EM>client</EM> to one...
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">And I can't just point you at the Gazette search engine 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> because "Exchange"
is way too common a word.  MX records and the server side of this question
will flood you, even without people just using the word for its real meaning.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">But, we had a mention in a past issue
(<A HREF="../issue58/lg_tips58.html#2c/6"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue58/lg_tips58.html#2c/6</A>) about Bynari having
a good one - they also have a server product.  So I think you might find the
Insight client to be just what you need!  (<A HREF="http://www.bynari.com"

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I post it again because I have to update you ... it's <EM>not</EM> free - you have to
pay them for their hard work in getting the protocols right.  Their website
has a "price special" but it appears to have expired a month ago, so I have
no idea what they cost, but it's probably not trying to be too expensive.
