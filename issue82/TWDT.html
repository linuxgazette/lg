<P>
Hi! Good day.
</P>
<P>
I've been looking for a good documentation on configuring Sendmail +
Courier IMAP (with MailDir) but I can't find one. My server's specs:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>Mandrake 8.2
<br>Sendmail 8.12
<br>Procmail 3.22
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Currently, I'm using the IMAP and POP server distributed with Mandrake. Im
using Postfix as my MTA before, but when I needed to use MailScanner
(<A HREF="http://www.mailscanner.info"
	>http://www.mailscanner.info</A>) I have no choice but to use Sendmail.
I want to switch to Courier IMAP and make use of their MailDir feature and
MySQL auth, but I can't find a good tutorial or howto. I believe you can
help me with this one.
</P>
<P>
Thanks and more power

<P>
I have been searching everywhere for a possible cause to this little
problem.  I have two LNE100tx Ethernet adapters in a Redhat Linux 7.1
machine with kernel version 2.4.9-34smp.  Eth0 is hooked to a 100tx
switch and Eth1 to a Toshiba cable modem, both using cat5e cable with
very short runs.  I use an iptables based firewall rule set to allow for
ip-masquerading.  The inside interface works perfectly, and so far as
I've seen the outside interface actually works perfectly in spite of the
fact that ifconfig shows that I have 0 tx packets on that interface and
tons of errors.  My real question is if these are true readings how can
I still ping this machine and receive responses without it transmitting
packets to the cable modem?  I have included some relevant output from
ifconfig, iptables -L as I'm not sure that it's not a conflict in my
rule set, and ping output from another location.  Any information on
this problem (even if it's just that the output of ifconfig is wrong)
would be greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
Ifconfig output:

<P><STRONG>
I have no problems finding references that multilink ppp dual modems are
possible in linux but for the life of me I can't find a step by step
guide how to set this up. I am a newbe using Mandrake 8.2 and would
really appreciate info on how to actually set my computer up for
multilink 56k modems. My ISP does provide this service.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You will most likely need to re-configure and compile your kernel - you
will need to install the source pkg from your Mandrake installation CD's
if it's not already installed.  I don't believe that that most distro
supplied kernels are configured for that.  From the kernel confg help:

</P>
<P>
If you have two serial connections to some other computer (this
usually requires two modems and two telephone lines) and you use
SLIP (the protocol for sending Internet traffic over telephone
lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave like
one double speed connection using this driver. Naturally, this has
to be supported at the other end as well, either with a similar EQL
Linux driver or with a Livingston Portmaster 2e.
</P>
<P>
Say Y if you want this and read Documentation/networking/eql.txt.
You may also want to read section 6.2 of the NET-3-HOWTO, available
via FTP (user: anonymous) from

As a long time self-taught user of Linux/Unix/Ultrix (and several other
flavours), I've become addicted to such handy tools as vi, grep, sed, awk,
ctags, and the bazillion other little utilities that can be so artisticly
chained together to produce the desired results.  I've stumbled across your
LG archives, and all I can say is "WOAH!"  I'm going to have to find myself
a text-to-speech translator so I can read/listen-to all of this good stuff
whilst at work, because there's just so much in here.  Thanks for such a
fabulous (and fun!) resource...

Glad you're enjoying it, Tim. Given that you do have this broad range of
experience, you might want to give a thought to joining The Answer Gang;
as far as I'm concerned, it's the most fun part of LG. You don't have to
have all the answers... as long as you have a few, you can contribute.

The unusual Subject: line and From: line suggest you received a message
from a Klez worm/virus.  Klez operates by choosing a To: address and a From:
address randomly from the user's Microsoft Outlook address book.  In other
words, it comes from someplace completely different than where it claims to
have come from.  If you know anybody who uses Outlook and has both your address
and LG's in their addressbook, you can warn them.  Or if you have the
original message, you can tell from its Received: headers which domain it
came from.  If you want to send me the headers, I can show you how to verify
whether it's Klez and what the originating domain is.
</P>
<P>
Usually Klez messages come with a binary attachment, but sometimes the program
goofs and sends only a one-liner.  Of course, you don't ever want to run -- or
let your computer automatically run -- a binary attachment from somebody you
don't know, because that's how viruses and worms spread.  Klez in particular
also tries to disguise the attachment so it looks like a different type than
it is.  For instance, it can disguise an executable program as a sound file,
which tricks certain versions of Windows into executing it.
</P>

In the 'mailbag' of the 'linux gazette' there was someone
(without e-mailadress) who had a question about running
a Linux server behind a w2k ICS server (Linux terminal
services server can't connect to internet via network)
Now I was wondering, should whoever reads this and
know a solution or more details then he/she does e-mail
to this adress so it'll come in the next mailbag? Is
that how this works? If so, I'd like to reply (very much)
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P>
I'm not entirely sure of that... but they're the same crew, (of people
mangling the replies) so if you know something, I'd say shoot.

I recently installed 2.4.18.  I've got 99% of the stuff I want/need

IIRC I had some probs playing stuff that wasn't the right sample-rate
(not midi, mind you), meaning 48kHz did play and 44100 not or other
way around. Maybe thats where the problem lies.
If noone else here can help you I can recommend debianhelp.org, maybe

That's very interesting - considering that they use completely different
methods and even different devices. "Timidity" actually doesn't use the
MIDI system (I don't remember whether it's "<TT>/dev/audio</TT>" or "<TT>/dev/dsp</TT>").
You can test these with
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>cat /etc/motd &gt; /dev/audio
cat /etc/motd &gt; /dev/dsp
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This should produce short bursts of noise for each device; if it
doesn't, you need to look into why that device isn't working.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
BTW, have you looked at your volume settings? Do realize that there are
different ones for different devices, and the relevant ones for what
you're doing may be turned way down.

<P>
If you use bash -- especially tab-completion -- you'll love this feature.
</P>
<P>
First, see (<A HREF="http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion"
	>http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion</A>).
Tarballs and RPMs are available to power up programmable completion for
your bash shell.
</P>
<P>
Once you install the software, try stuff like this ("&lt;TAB&gt;" literally
means "hit the tab button"):
</P>

<blockquote><pre>$ find -user &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ find -gid &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ rpm -e &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ killall &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ grep --&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ cvs &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ mount &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ kill -&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ kill -HUP &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ ssh adamm@&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
This last one should work without installing software.
</P>
<P>
The concept is simple but handy. Completion functions define what
arguments are useful to complete certain commands. Enjoy!

That's quite a broad question. Gurus like Richard Stevens, Douglas E

Richar Stevens' "UNIX Network Programming" book.

If you want to know about socket programming(I guess that's what you mean

Today, the curiosity bug bit me again, so I poked my nose into the Linux
Visor USB mailing list, and - lo and behold - there it was. Seems that the
new version of "coldsync", at least the beta, now handles the m125! I
downloaded it, configured it, compiled it, made a config file - and...
ta-daa! Palm USB synchronization, under Linux.

I assume that you have "usbcore", "usb-uhci", "usbserial", and "visor"
modules loaded, or the equivalent kernel options compiled in - yes?  I'm
running "coldsync" v2.2.5 my "~/.coldsyncrc" looks like this:

Obviously, you'll need to have the appropriate username and userid.
Other than that, the only assumption that we're making here is that the
130 works the same way as a 125 - not an unreasonable assumption, but
worth checking if things don't work out.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Ok, thanks,  I should probably contact the coldsync crew at this point.
If I'm doing something wrong then it is a problem with the documentation.

But one thing I have not confirmed is if we can directly use Linux
before installing the software given by AT&amp;T on Windows. If you have
already installed the software and are able to access the net, then above
config should work.

I am a novice linux enthusiast. i had a fried mbr some
time back and read your article in linux gazzette.
Clearing out the mbr worked fine. I only installed
windows 2000 after clearing the mbr.

But i am running into a problem now, when i try to
install linux again. I have used RedHat linux 7.2 the
first time ( when i damaged the mbr)...
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
The MBR isn't something you can really "damage"; it's just some bytes on
the first sector of the HD. Clearing it out pretty much puts paid to the
problem; there isn't anything that can be left over to cause later
problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
...and it installed
without any problem. But this time, as i try to create
the partitions, it is not able to create the partition
and pops up a message asking if i want to clear every
thing in the hard disk.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am using a 20GB seagate hard disk. If this problem
cant be rectified with the present hard disk, i am
willing to install a fresh separate hard disk for
linux. it appears that having both windows and linux
on the same hard disk is always causing problems.
please tell me how to go about installing a second
hard disk and loading linux on it, assuming that i
already have one hard disk that is currently running
windows 2000.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please advice. I hope i have made my problem clear.

[Ben] 
I can't really say what the current problem is, since you've
given minimum detail here... could I get you to report the exact message
that you see? I've never been a particular fan of DiskDruid (the
partitioning software used by RedHat's install), and automatically jump
to "fdisk" (or "cfdisk", for preference, if it's available) in case of
any partitioning problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Out of curiosity, do you have any available partitions for your Linux
installation? You can't just slap in another OS; if you only have one
partition (the one where Wind*ws is installed), then I can see a
situation where you would be asked to "clear the hard disk". If you need
to shrink your Wind*ws partition to make room for Linux, take a look at
FIPS (a quick Net search will bring it up.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Or use a flavor of Linux that prefers to live in a FAT filesystem -
either using UMSDOS or a giant file to be loopback mounted.  I believe
Phatlinux and BigSlack are likely candidates, but I've never used
either, so I can't say more.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Note that FIPS can only tweak FAT filesystems and its author isn't
updating it (since he's busy working on a Ph.D), while GNU parted
can also tweak ext2, and reiser filesystems.  I think it can do ext3,
or you might have to turn off the journals first so it's ext2 again.
Anyways there's a floppy rescue-disk that contains parted:

Hi, Matt here.  I found your address online while researching a problem.
We have had occasional problems with files being corrupted when we FTP them
to our test server.  The files being corrupted are web files(Cold Fusion).
I know some people use the ASCII transfer option and others are usig the
binary option.  Could the ASCII be the problem?  Thanks,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Matt
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Iron] 
FTP in binary mode transmits the file exaactly as is.  FTP in ASCII mode
changes the end-of-line characters to what the destination computer expects.
(Unix uses the linefeed character, Macintosh uses carriage-return, and
Windows uses both.)  Use ASCII mode only for plain text files.  Any other
type of file (.gz, .tar, image, word processor file, etc) must be transferred
in binary mode or it will be corrupted beyond usability.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
HTML and XML are text-based formats, so ASCII mode should be fine.  I don't
know whether Cold Fusion uses HTML format or its own format.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you've corrupted a binary file by transferring it in ASCII mode and there
are no backup copies available, you <EM>may</EM> be able to recover the data by doing
your steps exactly in reverse.  Go to the computer you ran the FTP program at,
start the exact same program, switch to ASCII mode, and do a PUT instead of a
GET (or vice versa).  That should reverse whatever changes it did.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">However, it's not guaranteed, since there might have been stray carriage
return or line feed characters which were not initially part of the
conversion.  You can also use the command line of infozip to pack
and then unpack a file to the same effect - handy if you no longer have
the originating system around, either. Infozip is the free 'zip' and
'unzip' found in most Linux distros.

that you sent in regarding
the problems that you were having when authenticating

via squid.
</P>
<P>
The errors that you are getting would seem to indicate
that your ACL's
have not been defined correctly (perhaps due to some
syntactical error),
or they do not exist. Now there could be a number of
reasons for this, and
it would be much more helpful to us if you could post
us a copy of your
"<TT>/etc/squid.conf</TT>" file, so that I can see exactly what
is going on.
</P>
<P>
How have you configured Samba and WinBind?? I will
hopefully be covering
Samba in my WM article in the near future -- have you
been able to
authenticate Windows2000 users on the Linux box for
anyother services
besides Squid??
</P>
<P>
Just as a point of interest (and something which was
not covered in my
article), I see from the very last line of your error
log, that you get:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>2002/07/15 10:46:23| Squid is already running!
Process ID 9957
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Since you already have squid running, I would have
suggested that if you
had only changed the configuration file, that you
simply ran:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>squid -k reconfigure
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
furthermore, if you have to stop the Squid process at
anytime, you should
always do it via the "<TT>/etc/init.d/squid</TT> stop" command.
To reload the PID,
use: "<TT>/etc/init.d/squid</TT> restart" -- assuming that the
squid process is
already running.  (sorry to digress from your main
problem).
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry if the level of detail is sketchy, but I
need more information
before I can begin to understand your problem in a
little more detail.
</P>
<P>
Kind Regards,
</P>

Hello folks, and welcome once more to the world of The Answer Gang.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It's been a crazy month for me.  Linux World Expo was a lot of fun.
At first glance, the silliness had gone out of it... mo more
colorful oddities delimiting the .Org Pavilion, people were wandering
around muttering that there aren't as many toys as there used to be, and
there was nobody in hot giant-character costumes.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
On the flip side our friendly local .org folks, at least the ones who
were present and manning their booths... a decent number... seemed to
be being treated with
the same respect that the businesses with small, ordinary kiosks were.
Maybe at later shows we'll see some of the .Org groups with meta-booths
for their variety the way the big comapnies do, funded by a corporate
entity here and there that uses what they have under its hood, and is
willing somehow to give up the glory of their own name at the center
of the booth.  Now that'd be cool.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
And there <EM>were</EM> toys - in great abundance - for those who paid the
respect to actually express a real curiosity about the products on
display.  Oh sure, there were a few grumpy sorts.  I didn't get given
an official <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Baseball Cap because some girl at the booth gave me
the brush-off: "At the end of our presentation".  I glanced at the shiny
paperwork, and decided I could visit 3 other booths in the time it would
take their presentation to finish.  I only had two half days at the show
and didn't feel inclined to waste them for a hat, an oversized t-shirt,
and a slideshow I can probably see online (if they're smart).
Most of the toys were much better than that too.  Glowing pens were
everywhere, but to get a green one you had to go to <A HREF="http://www.amd.com"
	>AMD</A>.
Jim asked them quite a bit about the Opterons' dual
processing improvements.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Best toys goes to <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/linux"
	>Sun</A> for
having different toys at each mini-booth within their area.  Of course they
were also announcing that their new LX50 is coming with Linux preloaded -
a Red Hat based distro with a perfectly tuned kernel and extra goodies
related to behaving well in a Sun-oriented environment.  Kudos for that
too 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One of <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/linux"
	>IBM</A>'s mini-booths was announcing an educational service - for free -
which roughly sounds like a great competitor to The Answer Gang.  Unfortunately, IBM's website made no particular splash of it, and my mild thrashing around didn't find it.  I applaud their ideas but usability and getting the word out is going to need better work than that.  Perhaps we can cajole them into sending a note to News Bytes about it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Linux seems to be under the hood of an awful lot of big storage devices lately.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I asked a few businessmen about what they thought of the show.  They see the
enthusiasm is up, the companies really trying to make the mark in the marketplace.  And As I think back on it - they're right - I saw very few booths where
people didn't seem to know which way is up, what Linux is, or anything like that.  A particular booth had a really cool looking shaker table, but had nothing
to do with embedded or even industrial computing.  Nada, Zip, null pointer overflow.  Duh.  But the dot-com winter is almost over; companies with the
wherewithal to not push too far into the glitz and glory, like
<A HREF="http://www.penguincomputing.com"
	>Penguin Computing</A>, are surving the
boom-bust cycle and doing okay.  "Mr. Gates, I'll be your server today"
was just as popular as the first time it appeared, though of course, 
it wasn't the only poster there.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The fellow stuck in the Microsoft booth explained sheepishly that they begged
and pleaded not to be put in the hatchery area.  He and I are both guessing,
but apparently some folks in charge of space allocation couldn't be convinced
that embedded dev tools <tt>!=</tt> linux dev tools ... it being a linux tradeshow and all.  However, they do have a new attitude with WinCE - free for non-commercial
use, including code so you can debug it.  And commercial entities can debug with it too;  you don't need royalty games until you start making derivitive works and trying to sell it ... although what else an embedded developer would do with it, I'm not clear.  But that puts them no worse off than the original <A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com"
	>Troll Tech</A> license, which satisfied some and annoyed others.  And he says they want to understand how our dev community works a bit better.  I'm reminded of a quote from Baylon 5

Grouse enough instead of act, and it will be too little, too late, because we can't route around bad laws <EM>after</EM> the're established nearly as well as we can prevent them, any more than software can do more than an occasional workaround past true hardware issues.

I hope you're on a Linux system since you asked your question to a Linux
forum.  Our new submission address is <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A> to
emphasize this fact; "answerguy" at ssc.com is obsolete and is read only
occasionally.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I assume your friend wants to burn his program onto a CD-ROM, since "ISO"
is often used as an abbreviation for ISO-9660, the filesystem type used on
CD-ROMs.  (ISO (www.iso.ch) actually stands for International Standards
Organization -- or "International Organization for Standardization" as they
call themselves -- an organization that publishes specifications not only for
CD-ROMs but also for film speeds and lots of other stuff.)

.exe is a file format, specifically the DOS/Windows executable format.

<blockQuote>

Some .exe files are "self-extracting archives" which are basically
a small MS-DOS PKZIP extractor and a PKZIP (".zip") file packaged
together as one file.  Under MS-DOS or compatible environments, you
can run the .exe file to extract the contents of the zip file.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Under Linux, the "unzip" utility can extract the contents of
the .exe file's PKZIP archive while ignoring the MS-DOS program.
See man unzip.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you don't have an unzip program on your Linux
system, install your distribution's zip package or see:
<A HREF="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip"
	>http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip</A>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If your .exe is in fact a self-extracting archive, it would be
convenient to extract the contents before turning them into an .iso
file for burning to CDROM.

(Linux uses an executable format called ELF, but does not use a filename
extension to distinguish those files.) ISO is not a file format in that sense,
it's a filesystem type.  A filesystem is what's on your hard drive partition,
what allows it to contain files and directories.  ext2 is Linux's standard
filesystem type, FAT-32 and NTFS are the current Windows filesystem types.
ISO-9660, sometimes abbreviated to "ISO", is the filesystem type used on
CD-ROMs.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, it is possible to put an entire ISO-9660 filesystem (or any filesystem)
into a regular file.  If you mount that file (using mount's "loop" option; see
"man mount" and "man losetup"), you will see all the files and directories on
it, just like if you'd mounted a CD-ROM.  This ISO filesystem-in-a-file is
sometimes called an "iso" file and may have the extension .iso .  Certain Linux
distributions use this convention to make ready-to-burn CD images available via
FTP.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In fact, this creating an ISO-9660 filesystem is a necessary step before a
data CD can be burned.  Sometimes the program stores it temporarily in a
regular file, and sometimes it uses other tricks to avoid creating the temporary
file (which is up to 700 MB).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To write a CD under Linux, see the CD-Writing HOWTO at <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org"
	>http://www.tldp.org</A> .
You can also use one of the GUI front ends such as <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>'s KOnCD).

Interestingly enough, I discovered, apparently El Torito bootability is
a feature of the image -- I burned those Linux BBC's from a bare ISO,
no command switches to tell the Windows burner to make it bootable, and
it Just Worked.

<blockQuote>
I hadn't realized that it was (in Linux terms) mkisofs, not cdrecord,
that did that work.

Hi

I have a problem

I try to boot my disks with Linux, the secondary disk is a copy of primary

I need boot with primary and secondary disk, like a backup or in special

secondary boot, in this way my system to follows brinding service.

I suspect that you have a stale <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> file laying around when you issue
this df command.  The df command reads <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> to find out about mount
points, and it easily gets confused by this.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Make sure that your <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> file is properly truncated during boot, and
that it gets properly populated with your mount information by your rc
scripts.  (Obviously the startup (rc) scripts on all general purpose
distributions already do this for you --- so this case only comes up when
you've messed with them, rolled your own, or when you've replicated the
system and/or booted it up in some odd way.

The original Unixes didn't have anything equivalent to <TT>/proc</TT>, so they had to
use <TT>/etc/mtab.</TT>  The concept of the kernel exposing its internal state through
the filesystem is a relatively recent invention.

Why does "mount" even use mtab if <TT>/proc/mounts</TT> is more accurate?  Whenever I
boot into single user mode, the "mount" listing shows the previous boot, not
the current one, because the root filesystem is read-only so it can't update
mtab.  But if I remember about <TT>/proc/mounts</TT>, all is well.
</STRONG></P>

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

There has been some debate on this over the years.  On the one hand
<TT>/proc</TT> is the canonical way for the Linux kernel to export state (expecially
"PROCess" status) to user space.  On the other hand the legacy of the
libraries and other forms of UNIX dictate the <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> file, maintained
by the mount command and read by df, du, and others (including the mount
command when it's used to display the currently mounted filesystems).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Raising some other limb we could note that there are some cases where
<TT>/proc</TT> is undesirable (particularly in embedded systems).  Arguably these
systems already need a different version of the procps suite (which
provides the ps and top commands).  If mount relied upon <TT>/proc/mounts</TT>
then these embedded systems would need special versions of that.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course we could increase the cruft support factor.  We could have
the appropriate library calls check for <TT>/proc/mounts</TT> and use it
preferentially.  They'd then back off to using <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> if <TT>/proc/mounts</TT>
where inaccessible.  I can hear Linus retching into a brown paper bag
somewhere --- undoubtedly intent on sticking that over my head to shut
me up on this.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If we choose <TT>/proc/mounts</TT> uniformly then we have a few problems.  First
we have to write some parts of the format in stone --- to properly
decouple future kernel implementation changes from userspace and library
work.  (I don't relish the prospect of the sorts of procfs changes that
occured circa 1.3.x which caused older versions of ps to core dump under
new kernels).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Personally I don't see a problem with that.  However, we have to keep in
mind that Linux' filesystem support is likely to change radically over
the next couple of stable kernel versions.  We know that Al Viro is
working on implementing "stackable" (or union, or translucent, or
overlay) filesystems and we see a bit more work on LVM and snapshot support
on the horizon.  It's not clear how much effect this will have on the
format of <TT>/proc/mounts</TT> --- how much data we'll need to add to it to
support sane userspace semantics.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, for now, just consider it to be one of those legacy bugaboos of
Linux.  As Heather has said, replacing <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> with a symlink to
<TT>/proc/mounts</TT> seems to mostly work "well enough."  Unfortunately I can't
think of examples of how it doesn't work, of things to look out for.

While there may be some small distro-specific information by the mtab
updaters which is lost, the beauty of knowing that when proc is mounted

I don't know.  It just invariably happens in a large enough crowd when
I suggest this symlink trick, someone objects in this way.  For all I
know BSDs have some trouble of this sort and it isn't even Linux-y.  But
some Linux variants try to do things in a more BSDish way, and if both
of those were so, I'd expect there might be something.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
My first concept is it might list the devices by their e2labels if they
have them, which proc never looks at.

I also remember hearing that mtab was the main reason (actually, the only
reason) why leaving the root filesystem read-only all the time was a bad idea.
(Assuming <TT>/tmp</TT> and <TT>/var</TT> are somewhere else, of course.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"mount" could, for instance, read <TT>/proc/mounts</TT> if available and fall back to
<TT>/etc/mtab</TT> if not.  Likewise, it could write mtab out if it's a regular file
but not if it's a symlink.

The question at hand regards the implication of the latter choice.
What's wrong with making <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> a symlink to <TT>/proc/mounts?</TT>  I don't
know.  Why do the maintainers of the main kernel and fsutils continue
to do it using a static <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> file?  (Legacy?)  Are there programming
disadvantages to setting the symlink?  (Note: my first question was about
the implications to the sysadmin, this last is about the implications
for the maintainers of the fsutils and other programmers).

Also, since I have devfs in my kernel but it's not mounted, <TT>/proc/mounts</TT> has
a funky line for the root partition.

On the flip side if you more commonly use the space to chroot into,
then you need to remember to mount the proc filesystem if things care
about it.  Many of the finer deamons do, anyway.

If you try to setup a group of users who can mount and unmount file systems
you are stuck with the dynamic <TT>/proc/mounts</TT> method:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/dev/hda5	/mnt/windows-data	vfat	user,uid=500,gid=500,umask=007	0 0
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
If mounted by a user who is in group 500 (windows) all members of the group
and root himself can use the file system. But if it comes to unmounting
there are problems if you use the <TT>/proc/mounts-linked-to-/etc/mtab</TT>
approach and therefore are missing the options field: Now only root can
unmount the file system while with a static <TT>/etc/mtab</TT> every member of
group 500 can unmount the partition.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So you have either option: Use the link approach to not care about correct
<TT>/etc/mtab</TT> in the case your system fails and miss some advanced (u)mount
functionality or use the static approach and be able to use it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Iron] 
But it works for me, at least for a user unmounting a partition that has the
"user" option in <TT>/etc/fstab</TT>, even though that column is missing in the
symlinked mtab.  The kernel should know which options it's mounted with, whether
that shows up in <TT>/proc/mounts</TT> or not.  And one would expect 'umount' to work
parallel to 'mount', which uses fstab information to supply default options.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Perhaps your system is different, or the vfat filesystem is underfeatured.

Here are some links and news related to the DMCA which you might find of
interest.
<P>
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947729.html">
News.com has reported</a> that
some of the supporters who helped the DMCA pass are having second thoughts.
This has emerged through a RIAA vs Silicon Valley debate sponsored by the
Cato Institute.
Wired 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,54270,00.html">
also reported</a>
on the same debate, focusing on how the computing revolution of 1950-2000
wouldn't have happened under today's copyright regime (DMCA).  This recalls
George Monbiot's
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/globalisation/story/0,7369,665969,00.html">
article</a> describing historically how the <em>absence</em> of patents has
produced strong economic growth.

Declan McCullagh of News.com has 
written that 
<a href="http://news.com.com/2010-12-950229.html?tag=fd_lede">
the DMCA is not so bad</a>
and the EFF is overreacting. 
<blockquote>
    "The DMCA is both an egregious law and a brazen power grab by Hollywood,
    the music industry and software companies. It is probably
    unconstitutional. It creates unnecessary federal crimes, cedes too much
    authority to copyright holders, and should be unceremoniously tossed
    out by the courts...  [However,] a careful look at the DMCA shows that, far from
    prohibiting all security research, the law does not regulate as many
    activities as people seem to believe. And if activists hope to assail a
    law like the DMCA, they'll be taken more seriously if they know what
    they're talking about."
</blockquote>
Slashdot readers 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/08/19/1623242.shtml?tid">
generally reacted with scepticism</a>, though there were some dissenting
voices.
LWN's 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/6998/">
coverage of these issues</a> is interesting reading too.
Also worth a look are

The Register reported</a> recently that
HP made moves to use the DMCA to quash a Tru64 bug report.
Later on, they appeared to see the public relations nightmare the tactic
could turn into
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/26508.html">

The Register
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/26717.html">
recently reported</a>
on the proposed United Kingdom implementation of the European
Union Copyright Directive (sometimes called "Europe's DMCA").
Comments are 
<a href="http://www.patent.gov.uk/about/consultations/eccopyright/index.htm">
currently being taken</a>
by the UK Patent Office, and these could influence the final shape of the
law.  It could 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26788.html">
turn out badly</a>, but if the UK government is encouraged to take
advantage of all available opt-outs, it would be a help.
Obviously this is primarily of interest to UK readers, but it has
relevance to all EU readers.

Microsoft and other players on the proprietary software scene
have been sufficiently rattled by advances of open source software
into government infrastructure to 
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-949527.html">
set up a lobby group</a> [News.com]
called
<em>The Initiative for Software Choice</em>
to convince governments in Europe and South America that legislation
favoring open-source software is not in their best interest.  
<P>
This is a reaction to developments such as
California's proposed
<em>Digital Software Security Act</em>, which would forbid the state
from purchasing closed-source software.  However,
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/7697/">
as LWN reports</a>, the law is quite extreme and has little chance of
actually being passed.  None the less, it is good to see these ideas
floating into the mainstream.  In a similar vein, it has been reported that
the Spanish Administration
<a href="http://newsvac.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/08/02/1321207&mode=thread&tid=51">
has been pleased</a>

<a href="http://www.wewantlinux.org">
We Want Linux</a>, a self-funded non-commercial group of IT professionals,
would like to see the computing consumer have as many options in the
marketplace as possible, and in particular would like to see those who have an
interest in GNU/Linux be able to try out a demo machine in stores like
CompUSA and Best Buy, the same way they can right now with Windows.
The group
also feels that the potential Linux desktop user ought to have the same
opportunity as those who use Windows, that is, to buy a computer with
Linux pre-loaded and thereby avoid the hassle of installing an
operating system.
To these ends the group have created a web site
<a href="http://www.wewantlinux.org">
www.wewantlinux.org</a>,
for the purpose of surveying the computer-buying public and
determining how much demand there is for off-the-shelf computers with

	</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In Parts <A HREF="../issue77/krishnakumar.html">I</A> and <A
HREF="../issue79/krishnakumar.html">II</A> of this series, we examined the
process of using tools available with Linux to build a simple boot sector and
access the system BIOS.  Our toy OS will be closely modelled after a `historic'
Linux kernel - so we have to switch to protected mode real soon! This part
shows you how it can be done.

<h2>1. What is <u>Protected Mode </u>?</h2>

<p>The 80386+ provides many new features to overcome the
deficiencies of 8086 which has almost no support for memory
protection, virtual memory, multitasking, or memory above 640K -
and still remain compatible with the 8086 family. The 386 has all
the features of the 8086 and 286, with many more enhancements. As
in the earlier processors, there is the real mode. Like the 286,
the 386 can operate in protected mode. However, the protected
mode on 386 is vastly different internally. Protected mode on the
386 offers the programmer better protection and more memory than
on the 286. The purpose of protected mode is not to protect your
program. The purpose is to protect everyone else (including the
operating system) from your program.</p>

<h2>1.1 Protected Mode vs Real Mode</h2>

<p>Superficially protected mode and real mode don't seem to be
very different. Both use memeory segmentation, interrupts and
device drivers to handle the hardware. But there are differences
which justify the existence of two separate modes. In real mode,
we can view memory as 64k segments atleast 16bytes apart.
Segmentation is handled through the use of an internal mechanism
in conjunction with segment registers. The contents of these
segment registers (CS,DS,SS...) form part of the physical address
that the CPU places on the addresss bus. The physical address is
generated by multiplying the segment register by 16 and then
adding a 16 bit offset. It is this 16 bit offset that limits us
to 64k segments.</p>

<p><em><strong>fig 1 : Real Mode Addressing </strong></em></p>

<p><img src="misc/raghu/fig1.png" width="349"
height="138"></p>

<p>In protected mode, segmentation is defined via a set of tables
called descriptor tables. The segment registers contain pointers
into these tables. There are two types of tables used to define
memory segmentation : The Global Descriptor Table and The Local
Descriptor Table. The GDT contains the basic descriptors that all
applications can access. In real mode one segment is 64k big
followed by the next in a 16 byte distance. In protected mode we
can have a segment as big as 4Gb and we can put it wherever we
want. The LDT contains segmentation information specific to a
task or program. An OS for instance could set up a GDT with its
system descriptors and for each task an LDT with appropriate
descriptors. Each descriptor is 8 bytes long. The format is given
below (fig 3). Each time a segment register is loaded, the base
address is fetched from the appropriate table entry. The contents
of the descriptor is stored in a programmer invisible register
called shadow registers so that future references to the same
segment can use this information instead of referencing the table
each time. The physical address is formed by adding the 16 or 32
bit offset to the base address in the shadow register.These
differences are made clear in figures 1 and 2.</p>

<p><em><strong>fig 2 : Protected Mode Addressing</strong></em></p>

<p><img src="misc/raghu/fig2.png" width="436"
height="233"></p>

<p><em><strong>fig 3 : Segment Descriptor Format</strong></em></p>

<p><img src="misc/raghu/fig3.png" width="432"
height="130"></p>

<p>We have yet another table called the interrupt descriptor
table or the IDT. The IDT contains the interrupt descriptors.
These are used to tell the processor where to find the interrupt
handlers. It contains one entry per interrupt, just like in Real
Mode, but the format of these entries is totally different. We
are not using the IDT in our code to switch to the protected mode
so further details are not given. </p>

<h2>2. Entering Protected Mode</h2>

<p>The 386 has four 32 bit control registers named CR0, CR1, CR2
and CR3. CR1 is reserved for future processors, and is
undefined for the 386. CR0 contains bits that enable and
disable paging and protection and bits that control the
operation of the floating point coprocessor. CR2 and CR3 are
used by the paging mechanism. We are concerned with bit 0 of the
CR0 register or the PE bit or the protection enable bit. When PE
= 1, the processor is said to be operating in protected mode with
the segmentation mechanism we described earlier. If PE = 0, the
processor operates in real mode. The 386 also has the
segmentation table base registers like GDTR, LDTR and
IDTR.These registers address segments that contain the descriptor
tables. The GDTR points to the GDT. The 48 bit GDTR defines the
base and the limit of the GDT directly with a 32 bit linear
address and a 16 bit limit.</p>

<p>Switching to protected mode essentially implies that we set
the PE bit. But there are a few other things that we must do. The
program must initialise the system segments and control
registers. Immediately after setting the PE bit to 1 we have to
execute a jump instruction to flush the execution pipeline of any
instructions that may have been fetched in the real mode. This
jump is typically to the next instruction. The steps to switch to
protected mode then reduces to the following :</p>

<ol>
    <li>Build the GDT.</li>
    <li>Enable protected mode by setting the PE bit in CR0.</li>
    <li>Jump to clear the prefetch queue.</li>
</ol>

<p>We'll now give the code to perform this switching. </p>

<h2>3. What we need </h2>

<ul>
    <li>a blank floppy</li>
    <li>NASM assembler</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="misc/raghu/code.asm.txt">Click here</a> to download the code.
Type in the code to a file by name abc.asm. 
Assemble it by typing the command <strong>nasm abc.asm</strong>.
This will produce a file called abc. Then insert the floppy and
type the following command <strong>dd if=abc of=/dev/fd0.</strong>
This command will write the file abc to the first sector of the
floppy. Then reboot the system. You should see the following
sequence of messages.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Our os booting........................</li>
    <li>A (Brown colour)</li>
    <li>Switching to protected mode....</li>
    <li>A (White colour)</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. The Code that does everything !</h2>

<p>We'll first give the code to perform the switching. It is
followed by a detailed explanation. </p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous article (Part 1) the BIOS selects 
the boot device and places the first sector into the address 0x7c00.
We thus start writung our code at 0x7c00.This is what is implied by 
the org directive.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS USED</h2>

<p><strong>print_mesg</strong>: This routine uses the subfunction 13h 
of BIOS interrupt 10h to write a string to the screen.The attributes 
are specified by placing appropriate values in various registers.
Interrupt 10h is used for various string manipulations.We store the 
subfn number 13h in ah which specifies that we wish to print a string.
Bit 0 of the al register determines the next cursor position;if it is 
0 we return to the beginning of the next line after the function call,
if it is 1 the cursor is placed immediately following the last 
character printed.</p>

<p>The video memory is split into several pages called 
video display pages.Only one page can be displayed at a time(For 
further details on video memory refer Part 1).The contents of bh 
indicates the page number,bl specifies the colour of the character to
be printed. cx holds the length of the string to be printed.Register 
dx specifies the cursor position. Once all the attributes have been 
initialised we call BIOS interrupt 10h.</p>

<p><strong>get_key</strong>: We use BIOS interrupt 16h whose sub 
function 00h is used to get the next character from the screen.
Register ah holds the subfn number.</p>

<p><strong>clrscr</strong>: This function uses yet another subfn of 
int 10h i.e 06h to clear the screen before printing a string.To 
indicate this we initialise al to 0.Registers cx and dx specify the 
window size to be cleared;in this case it is the entire screen.
Register bh indicates the colour with which the screen has to be 
filled;in this case it is black.</p>

<h2><strong>Where everything begins !!</strong></h2>
<p>The first assembly language statement is a short jump to the 
begin_boot code.We intend to print a brown 'A'in real-mode,set up a 
GDT,switch to protected mode and print a white 'A'.Both these modes 
use their own addressing methods.</p>

<p><strong>In Real-Mode</strong> :</p>
<p>We use segment register gs to point to video memory.We use a CGA 
adapter(default base address 0xb8000).But hey we have a missing 0 in 
the code.Well the Real-mode segmentation unit provides the additional 
0.This is a matter of convenience,as the 8086  usually does a 20bit 
address manipulation.This has been carried over in the real-mode 
addressing of the 386.The ascii value for A is 0x41;0x06 specifies 
that we need a brown coloured character.The display stays till we 
press a key.Next let us display a message on the screen saying we are 
going to the world of protected mode.So let us point the bp(base 
pointer register to the message to be printed).</p>

<p><strong>Launchpad to the protected mode</strong> :</p>
<p>We don't need any interrupts bothering us,while in protected mode 
do we ?So lets disable them(interrupts that is).That is what cli does.
We will enable them later.So lets start by setting up the GDT.We 
initialise 4 descriptors in our attempt to switch to protected mode. 
These descriptors initialise our code segment(code_gdt), data and stack 
segments (data_gdt) and the video segment in order to access the video 
memory. A dummy descriptor is also initialised although it's never 
used except if you want to triple fault of course. This is a null 
descriptor. Let us probe into some of the segment descriptor fields.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The first word holds the limit of the segment, which for 
     simplicity is assigned the maximum of FFFF(4G). For the video 
     segment we set a predefined value of 3999 (80 cols * 25 rows 
     * 2bytes - 1).</li>
<li> The base address of the code and data segments is set to 0x0000.
     For the video segment it is 0xb8000 (Video Memory base address).
</li>
</ul>

<p> The GDT base address has to be loaded into GDTR system register.
The gdtr segment is loaded with the size of the GDT in the first word 
and the base address in the next dword. The lgdt instruction then loads
the gdt segment into the GDTR register.Now we are ready to actually 
switch to pmode. We start by setting the least significant bit of CR0
to 1( ie the PE bit).We are not yet in full protected mode!</p>

<p>Section 10.3 of the INTEL 80386 PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE MANUAL 1986 
states : Immediately after setting the PE flag,the initialization 
code must flush the processor's instruction prefetch queue by 
executing a JMP instruction.The 80386 fetches and decodes instructions
and addresses before they are used; however, after a change into 
protected mode, the prefetched instruction information (which pertains
to real-address mode) is no longer valid. A JMP forces the processor 
to discard the invalid information.</p>

<p>We are in protected mode now. Want to check it out? Let's get our 
A printed in white. For this we initialise the data and extra segments 
with the data segment selector (datasel). Initialise gs with the video
segment selector (videosel). To display a white 'A' move a word 
containing the ascii value and attribute to location [gs:0000] ie 
b8000 : 0000. The spin loop preserves the text on the screen until 
the system is rebooted.</p>

<p>The times instruction is used to fill in 0s in the remaining 
unused bytes of the sector.To indicate that this is a bootable sector
we write AA55 in bytes 511,512. That's about all. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The first computer networks were used to send e-mails and share files and printers 
  between researchers and corporate employees. In such a scenario security was 
  not given much thought. Now the computer networks (especially the Internet) 
  are used by millions for banking, shopping and filing their tax returns, and 
  network security has become a major problem. Network security can be divided 
  into four areas. 
<dl> 
  <dt><STRONG>Secrecy</STRONG> </dt>
  <dd>Secrecy has to do with keeping information out of the reach of nosy unauthorized 
    people. </dd>
  <dt><STRONG>Authentication</STRONG></dt>
  <dd>Authentication deals with determining the identity of the communication 
    partner, whether it/he/she is an impostor or the real thing. </dd>
  <dt><STRONG>Non repudiation</STRONG></dt>
  <dd>Non repudiation deals with signatures: it uniquely identifies the sender 
    of a message or file. How can you prove that the order for "10 million left 
    shoes only" came from your customer when he claims he ordered "10 right shoes 
    only". </dd>
  <dt><STRONG>Integrity control</STRONG></dt>
  <dd>Integrity control assures that vital data has not been modified. Integrity 
    is critical for conducting commerce over the Internet. Without assured integrity, 
    purchase orders, contracts, specifications, or stock purchase orders could 
    be modified with devastating effects. </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Need for Authentication</h2>
<p> Why do we need an authentication service? An authentication service verifies 
  the identity of the communication partner. Authentication is a fundamental building 
  block of a secure network environment. If a server knows for certain the identity 
  of its client, it can decide whether to provide it a particular service (for 
example.. printing facility) or not, whether to give the user special privileges etc. As 
  an aside authentication and <em>authorization</em> are different. If user Foo 
  says <em> "delete file bar"</em>, then the problem of verifying whether the 
  command came from Foo is authentication. The problem of verifying whether Foo 
  has permission to delete file bar is authorization. </p>
<p> Let's take an example of Alice, who wishes to deal with Bob, her banker. In real 
  life Bob and Alice can authenticate each other by recognizing each others faces, 
  voices or handwriting . However if they wish to transact over network none of 
  these options are available. How can Bob be sure that the request to transfer 
  all of Alice's money to a secret Swiss bank account came from Alice and not 
  from Eve? </p>
<p>This is where an authentication service comes in. Alice starts by sending out 
  a message to Bob. As these messages are being sent, we have Eve, an intruder, 
  who may intercept, modify or replay the messages to trick Alice and Bob or just 
  to throw a spanner in the works. Nevertheless when the authentication is 
complete, Alice 
  is sure she is talking to Bob and Bob is sure that he is talking to Alice. </p>
<h2>Enter Kerberos</h2>
<p>Kerberos was created by MIT as a solution to network security problems. It 
  has its roots in Project Athena, started in 1983. The aim of Project Athena 
  was to create an educational computing environment built around high-performance 
  graphic workstations, high speed networking, and servers of various types. Project 
  Athena used Kerberos as its authentication system. The name Kerberos comes from 
  Greek mythology; it is the three-headed dog that guarded the entrance to Hades. 
  The Kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove its 
  identity to a server (and vice verse) across an insecure network connection. 
  After a client and server have used Kerberos to prove their identity, they can 
  also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data integrity 
  as they go about their business. </p>
<p>From 
<a title="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/www/ " href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/www/">
http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/www/</a>
  <blockquote><em>
Many of the protocols used in the Internet do not provide any security. 
  Tools to "sniff" passwords off the network are in common use by systems crackers. 
  Thus, applications which send an unencrypted password over the network are extremely 
  vulnerable. Worse yet, other client/server applications rely on the client program 
  to be "honest" about the identity of the user who is using it .Other applications 
  rely on the client to restrict its activities to those which it is allowed to 
  do, with no other enforcement by the server.</em> </blockquote>

<p> The original design and implementation of Kerberos Versions 1 through 4 was 
  the work of two former Project Athena staff members, Steve Miller of Digital 
  Equipment Corporation and Clifford Neuman (now at the Information Sciences Institute 
  of the University of Southern California), along with Jerome Saltzer, Technical 
  Director of Project Athena, and Jeffrey Schiller, MIT Campus Network Manager. 
  Many other members of Project Athena have also contributed to the work on Kerberos. 
  The latest version of Kerberos 4 from MIT is patch level 10.It is officially 
  considered "dead" by MIT; all current development is concentrated on Kerberos 
  5. The latest version of Kerberos 5 is 1.2.1. </p>
<h2>Some Keywords First </h2>
<p> The art of devising ciphers is known as <strong>cryptography</strong> and 
  breaking them is known as <strong>cryptanalysis</strong>; together they are 
  known as <strong>cryptology </strong>. The message to be encrypted is known 
  as <strong>plaintext</strong> or <strong>cleartext</strong>. The plaintext is 
  encrypted by using a function, which takes as a parameter a <strong>key</strong>. 
The output of the encryption process is known as <strong>ciphertext </strong>.When 
  ciphertext is put through a <strong> decryption function</strong>, we get back 
  the plaintext. Going back to our story of Alice and Bob, they (Alice and Bob) 
  are sometimes referred to as <strong>principals</strong>, the main characters 
  of the story. </p>
<p> Traditionally, the encryption key is same as the decryption key. The key is 
known only to the principals. Such a key is known as <strong>shared secret 
  key</strong>. However in a cypto system proposed by Diffie and Hellman 
(researchers 
  at Stanford University) in 1976, the encryption and decryption keys are 
different. The 
  key to be used for encryption is made public so that messages to be sent to 
  that user can be encrypted using the publicly available key. This key is known 
  as the <strong> public key</strong>. Each user also has a <strong>private key 
  </strong>,known only to the user, which is used for decrypting messages sent 
  to the user. This system is known as <strong>public-key cryptography </strong>, 
  to contrast with shared-key cryptography. The RSA algorithm is an example of 
  public-key cryptography. </p>
<h2>And Some More ...</h2>
<p> Before describing the authentication process, it is important to remove ambiguities 
  in the terms to be used. </p>
<p> Often network applications are made of two parts, 
<ul>
  <li>the part which requests a service, called the client side of the application 
  </li>
  <li>the part which provides the service, called the server side of the application 
  </li>
</ul>
In a sense, every entity that uses the Kerberos system is a client. To distinguish 
between the Kerberos client and the client of a service, the client using the 
Kerberos service is known as a <strong>Kerberos client</strong>. The term <strong>application 
server</strong> refers to the server part of the application, that the clients 
communicate with using Kerberos for authentication. 
<p></p>
<p> Kerberos is a trusted <strong>third party authentication system</strong>. It 
  is trusted in the sense that each of its client believes the judgment of the 
  Kerberos' as to the identity of each of its other client to be accurate. To 
  prove to the application server that it (Kerberos client) is trusted by the 
  Kerberos server, it uses a <strong>ticket </strong>.In order for the Kerberos 
  client to use any application server, a ticket is required. The server examines 
  the ticket to verify the identity of the user. If all checks out, then the client 
  is accepted. Along with a ticket an <strong>authenticator</strong> is also used 
  by a Kerberos client to prove its identity. The authenticator contains the additional 
  information which, when compared against that in the ticket proves that the 
  client presenting the ticket is the same one to which the ticket was issued. 
</p>
<p>Kerberos maintains a database of its clients and their private keys for authentication. 
  Because Kerberos knows these private keys, it can create messages which convince 
  one client that another is really who it claims to be. The designers did not 
  expect the entire world to trust a single database, so they made provision for 
  having different <strong>realms</strong>. The realm is an administrative entity 
  that maintains authentication data. Each organization wishing to run a Kerberos 
  server establishes its own "realm". </p>
<h2>And Now the Details </h2>
<p> Kerberos assumes that the Kerberos clients are not trustworthy and requires 
  the client to identify itself every time a service is requested from some other 
  Kerberos client. The technique used by Kerberos are unobtrusive. Kerberos follows 
  the following guidelines: 
<ul>
  <li>Passwords are never sent across the network in cleartext. They are always 
    encrypted. Additionally, passwords are never stored on Kerberos clients or 
    server in cleartext.</li>
  <li>Every client has a password i.e. every application server, user, Kerberos client 
    has a password.</li>
  <li>The <em>only </em> entity that knows all the password is the Kerberos server 
    and it operates under considerable physical security. </li>
</ul>
<p> Both the client and the application server are required to have keys registered 
  with the authentication server (AS). If the client is a user, his key is derived 
  from a password that he chooses; the key for a service (for example. a printing daemon) 
  is a randomly selected key. These keys are negotiated during the registration 
  of the clients. </p>
The authentication process proceeds as follows: 
<ol>
  <li>A client sends a request to the authentication server requesting "credentials" 
    for a given application server. The credentials consist of a ticket for the 
    server and a session key. The ticket contains, along with other fields, the 
    name of the server, the name of the client, the Internet address of the client, 
    a timestamp, a lifetime, and session key. This information (the ticket) is 
    encrypted using the key of the server for which the ticket will be used. 
  Once the ticket has been issued, it may be used multiple times by the named client 
    to gain access to the named server, until the ticket expires. 
    <blockquote><em> Why is a timestamp included? The timestamp is put to prevent 
      someone else from copying the ticket and using it to impersonate the Kerberos 
      client at a later time. This type of attack is known as a r<strong>eplay</strong>. 
      Because 
      clocks don't always work in perfect synchrony, a small amount of leeway 
      (about five minutes is typical) is given between the timestamp and the current 
      time. </em> </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The AS responds with these credentials (the ticket and the session key), 
    encrypted in the client's key. The AS also includes its name in the credentials 
    to convince the Kerberos client that the decryption by the server was 
  successful 
    and the message came from the server. 
    <blockquote><em> The AS does not know whether the client is actually the principal 
      which initiated the request for a the ticket. It simply sends a reply without 
      knowing or caring whether they are the same. This is acceptable because 
      nobody but the Kerberos client whose identity was given in the request will 
      be able to use the reply. Its critical information is encrypted in that 
      principal's key. </em> </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The Kerberos client decrypts the credentials using its key to extract the 
    session key. Note that because the ticket is encrypted in the key of the application 
    server, a Kerberos client cannot decrypt it.</li>
  <li>In order to gain access to the application server, the Kerberos client builds 
    an authenticator containing the clients name and IP address, and the current 
    time. The authenticator is then encrypted in the session key that was received 
    with the ticket for the server. The client then sends the authenticator along 
    with the ticket to the server. </li>
  <li> The service decrypts the ticket with its own key, extracting the session 
    key and the identity of the Kerberos client which the server sent it inside 
    the ticket. It then opens the authenticator with the session key. The authenticator 
    and the ticket demonstrate the identity of the client. </li>
  <li> The session key (now shared by the client and application server) is used 
    to authenticate the client, and may optionally be used to authenticate the 
    server. It may also be used to encrypt further communication between the two 
    parties or to exchange a separate sub-session key to be used to encrypt further 
    communication. </li>
</ol>
<h3>The Ticket Granting Ticket</h3>
<p>One of the goals of the Kerberos system is to remain as unobtrusive as 
possible. In the above exchange, the Kerberos client has to enter in a password every time 
  it has to decrypt the credentials passed to it by the AS . If the Kerberos client 
  is a user it becomes quite irritating to enter his password to have a file 
  printed or whenever he wants modify a file on the network (remember that the 
  key is derived from the user's password). The obvious way around this is to 
  cache the key derived from the password. But caching the key is dangerous. With 
  a copy of this key, an attacker could impersonate the user at any time (until 
  the password is next changed). </p>
<p>Kerberos resolves this problem by introducing a new agent, called the ticket 
  granting server (TGS). The TGS is logically distinct from the AS, although they 
  may reside on the same physical machine. (They are often referred to collectively 
  as the KDC--the Key Distribution Center). The function of the TGS is as follows. 
  Before accessing any regular service, the user requests a ticket to contact 
  the TGS, just as if it were any other service. This usually occurs when the 
  user first logins into the system. This ticket is called the ticket granting 
  ticket (TGT). After receiving the TGT, any time that the user wishes to contact 
  a service, he requests a ticket not from the AS, but from the TGS. Furthermore, 
  the reply is encrypted not with the user's secret key, but with the session 
  key that the AS provided for use with the TGS. Inside that reply is the new 
  session key for use with the regular service. The rest of the exchange now continues 
  as described above. The TGT is good only for a fairly short period, typically 
  eight hours. </p>
<h3>Cross Realm Authentication</h3>
<p>
The Kerberos protocol is designed to operate across organizational
boundaries.  A client in one organization can be authenticated to a
server in another.  Each organization wishing to run a Kerberos
server establishes its own "realm".  The name of the realm in which a
client is registered is part of the client's name, and can be used by
the application server to decide whether to honor a request.
</p>
<p> By establishing "inter-realm" keys, the administrators of two realms can allow 
  a client authenticated in the local realm to use its authentication remotely 
  The exchange of inter-realm keys registers the ticket-granting service of each 
  realm as a principal in the other realm. A client is then able to obtain a ticket-granting 
  ticket for the other realm's ticket-granting service from its local realm. When 
  that ticket-granting ticket is used, the other ticket-granting service uses 
  the inter-realm key (which usually differs from its own normal TGS key) to decrypt 
  the ticket-granting ticket, and is thus certain that it was issued by the client's 
  own TGS. Tickets issued by the remote ticket- granting service will indicate 
  to the end-service that the client was authenticated from another realm.
 </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kerberos is not a one-shot solution to the network security problem.Trust is inherent 
throughout the system: the client trusts Kerberos, if it correctly provides the client's 
encryption key.The application trusts the client if the client successfully provides a
ticket that is encrypted using the server's key.In this trust lies the weakness of the system.

<p>Specifically speaking, secret keys should be kept just that, secret. If an intruder somehow
steals a principal's key, it will be able to impersonate the principal. "Password guessing" 
attacks are not solved by Kerberos. If a user chooses a poor password, it is possible for an 
attacker to successfully mount an dictionary attack.Kerberos makes no provisions for client's
security; it assumes that it is running on trusted clients with an untrusted network. If the
client's security is compromised, then Kerberos is compromised as well. However, the degree to 
which Kerberos is compromised depends on the host that is compromised. If an attacker breaks 
into a multi-user machine and steals all of the tickets stored on that machine, he can
impersonate the users who have tickets stored on that machine .... but only until those 
tickets expire.

<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>
Since its initial installation on my machine in 2000, Linux
has fulfilled my computing needs.
I use Linux for the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>web browsing and email
<li>software development
<li>writing articles
<li>web site hosting
<li>digital photography
</ul>

<p>
This article focuses on the last item, digital photography, and 
describes how I use Linux to store,
manipulate, and share my digital photographs.
</p>



<a name=2></a>
<h3>Storing Photographs</h3>


<p>
I store my photographs in two places: on my hard drive, which
acts as short-term storage, and on CD-ROM, where the photographs are
permanently stored. I keep the last few months of photographs
on my machine so they can be recalled quickly, and I
transfer the older ones to CD-ROM to free up space on my drive.
</p>



<p>
To download photographs from my camera to my computer, I use
the <b><a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/">USB Mass Storage Driver</a></b>.
This driver is part of the Linux kernel, and
lets me mount my camera as a SCSI device. I then use the
<b>mv</b> command to transfer the photographs to my
hard disk. My session usually looks like the following:
</p>

<pre>
prompt$ mount -n /dev/sdb1 /mnt/camera
prompt$ mv /mnt/camera/dcim/100msdcf/* /home/robt/docs/photographs/
prompt$ umount -n /mnt/camera
</pre>

<p>
Pretty simple, right? I mount the camera, move the photographs to
a directory on my hard disk, and then unmount the camera.
</p>

<p>
(The USB Mass Storage Driver works with only a few camera models.  Mine is a
Sony DSC-F707.  Many other cameras such as the Canon PowerShot series are
recognized by the <A HREF="http://www.gphoto.org/">Gphoto2</A> program.  Some
cameras don't work yet under Linux -- it all depends on the camera manufacturer
giving us, the free software community, enough technical specifications that
we can write a driver.)
</p>

<p>
When my hard disk becomes filled, I transfer the older photographs to
CD-ROM.
I accomplish this by placing a blank CD-ROM in my CD Writer and
typing the following at a command prompt
(see the 
<b><a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html">
CD Writing HOWTO</a></b> for information on how to use your
CD Writer):
</p>


<pre>
prompt$ mkisofs -t iso9660 -o ro,loop=/dev/loop0 cd_image /home/robt/docs/photographs
prompt$ cdrecord -v speed=4 dev=0,0,0 -data cd_image
</pre>

<p>
This creates a cd image containing my photographs, and
burns the image to a fresh CD-ROM.
</p>

<a name=3></a>
<h3>Manipulating Photographs</h3>

<p>
In photography, <i>composition</i> deals with the placement of objects
within the frame of the photograph. A photographer makes many important
decisions when composing a photograph:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I include X in the photograph?
<li>Should I shoot this horizontally, or vertically?
<li>How much depth-of-field should there be?
</ul>


<p>
As a novice photographer, my composition skills are lacking. 
I usually include too much background in my photographs,
and I am oblivious to the camera's numerous features.
</p>

<p>
I use the <b><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a></b>
to salvage my poor photographs. GIMP
stands for the GNU Image Manipulation Program - it is
a full-featured image manipulation application, similar
to Adobe's Photoshop. I use it to perform the following:
</p>


<ul>
<li>crop photographs that are not composed correctly
<li>change the saturation of colors in photographs
<li>sharpen photographs that are blurry 
</ul>


<p>
These are only a few of the GIMP's features, but they greatly improve
the quality of my photographs. I look forward to learning more
about the GIMP.
</p>

<a name=4></a>
<h3>Sharing Photographs</h3>

<p>
I share my digital photographs with friends and family. I accomplish this
by posting the photographs to a publicly-accessible web site.
Before posting, however, I do the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>resize the photographs to a suitable web size
<li>create thumbnails of the photographs
<li>generate the HTML needed to display the photographs  on a web page
</ul>

<p>
I use two 
<b><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a></b> scripts to perform these
operations automatically.
The first is named 
<a href="misc/tougher/generate_photographs.py.txt">generate_photographs</a>. 
This script uses the 
<b>convert</b> command to
create web-sized photographs and thumbnails (<b>convert</b> is part of
the <b><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a></b> 
suite of tools. Definitely check them out). The following
is the complete script:
</p>


<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

#
# Prints the call to
# stdout, and then sends it
# to the OS.
#
def system_call(s):
	print s
	os.system(s)


#
# Clear out the directories. "small"
# contains thumbnails, and "medium"
# contains web-sized photographs.
#
for d in ("small", "medium"):

	system_call("rm -rf " + d)
	system_call("mkdir " + d)



files = os.listdir("photographs")

for file in files:

	if file != ".directory":

		system_call("convert -resize 640x480 photographs/" + file + " medium/" + file)
		system_call("convert -resize 160x120 medium/" + file + " small/" + file)
</pre>



<p>
The second script is named 
<a href="misc/tougher/generate_html.py.txt">generate_html</a>. 
It loops through the photographs,
and creates the HTML needed to display them on a web page. The following
is the script, trimmed to show the Python code only:
</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

#
# HTML-related stuff removed....
#
html = ""


files = os.listdir("photographs")
br = 0

for file in files:

	html += '&lt;a href="medium/' + file + '"&gt;'
	html += '&lt;img src="small/' + file + '"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;\n'
	html += '&lt;/a&gt;'

	if br:
		html += '&lt;br&gt;\n'
		br = 0
	else:
		br = 1

#
# HTML-related stuff removed....
#


f = open("index.php","w+b")
f.write(html)
f.close()
</pre>


<p>
After running these two scripts, I post the files
to my web site, and email the address to everyone.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
In this article I described how I use Linux to
store, manipulate, and share
my digital photographs. Hopefully I explained
my techniques clearly enough so that you can use
them for your digital photography needs.

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>Introduction.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Automatic firewall hardening
is a technique used by many commercial firewalls to prevent
invalid packets from reaching protected networks. The objective
of this document is to demonstrate how to harden iptables in real-time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">By default, iptables can log
messages via the Linux syslogd daemon. Logs by themselves are
fine for basic security but do not address advanced security
issues. For advanced security a system needs to run&nbsp;custom
scripts as soon as illegal operations are logged by&nbsp;the
firewall. Depending on the severity of the violations, you can
program these scripts to perform various actions such as blocking
offending IP addresses. The techniques outlined in this document
are not limited to iptables, and can also be modified to process
output from any application which logs via syslog e.g. intrusion
detection scanners such as SNORT.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>The Theory.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Linux syslogd incorporates
an interesting feature which allows it to redirect its output to
user defined pipes instead of log files. I will use a Perl script
to process messages coming from syslogd&nbsp;and dynamically
reconfigure iptables.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>What You Will Need.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The examples in this
document use a postgresql server. Most people are familiar with
MySQL ,so porting should not be a problem. I prefer Postgres
because it has many features present in commercial databases. For
more information about PostgreSQL visit </font><a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</a><font
size="2" face="Courier New">. You will also need the postgresql-perl,
Perl and iptables packages installed on the firewall machine. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">On the postgreSQL server
create a database called &quot;adaptive&quot; and a table called
&quot;iptables&quot;. Add the folowing fields.</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">ipaddress as char 16 </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">severity as int4 </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">time as datetime</font></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>Basic Security.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">TO DO: More detail on MAC
addressses and ARP poisoning.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">In my opinion, the only
services, which should be running on a firewall, are syslog and
cron. You should also have a printer logging whatever gets sent
to syslog. The reason for having a printer is that if your
machine does get hacked, and the cracker overwrites the logs, you
will still be able to see how the exploit was performed. Your
firewall should also preferably be running off a CD-ROM and
loading its ruleset from a write protected floppy disk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Knowing the MAC addresses
present on your network is very important. The firewall must be
aware of any rogue MAC addresses, which may be originating from a
machine which, may have been unlawfully introduced into your
network.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>Locking Down The
Firewall During The Boot Process.</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The first step that you will
want to take is to secure your firewall while it is booting. By
default, iptables allows unrestricted packet movement on the
INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD chains. This poses a security threat
while your machine is booting, and opens up your network to
various types of assault. To avoid this, you must instruct
iptables to block all packet movement BEFORE the network
interfaces start up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">On the Redhat distributions
the link &quot;S10network&quot; found in &quot;/etc/rc.d/rc3.d&quot;
is responsible for starting the network. You may also have &quot;S08iptables&quot;
found in &quot;/etc/rc.d/rc3.d&quot;. This link is responsible
for initialising the firewall routines. I prefer to delete the
default &quot;S08iptables&quot; link and create my own link
starting with &quot;S08&quot;. The link starting with &quot;S08&quot;
gets executed before the one starting with &quot;S10&quot; thus
ensuring that no packets get through.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">There are various kernel
options which you can set to enhance security. A few of them are
set in the example below.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">In order to secure the
firewall during boot, do the following:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Go to the &quot;/etc/rc.d&quot;
        directory </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Using your favorite
        text editor create a file called &quot;rc.autofwinit&quot;
        </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Copy and paste the
        script below into &quot;rc.autofwinit&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Exit the editor. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Execute the command
        &quot;chmod 755 rc.autofwinit&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Go to the &quot;/etc/rc.d/rc3.d&quot;
        directory </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Execute the command
        &quot;rm -f S08iptables&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Execute the command
        &quot;ln -s /etc/rc.d/rc.autofwinit S08iptables_start&quot;
        </font></li>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">A. The hardening script in
this tutorial is very basic. Since the script automatically bans
machines, you can imagine what would happen if someone managed to
spoof the source addresses. In this case, legitimate IP addresses
would get blocked. However, during a legitimate attack, you could
identify which domain was the most offending, and ban any machine
attempting to connect from it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Q. Why is my firewall
continuously logging ACK, FIN, URGP=0 ?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">A. In 99.99% cases this is
normal behaviour. This is due to the connection state matching
code in Iptables which by default tracks each connection for 60
seconds. Once a connection is inactive for 60 seconds, Iptables
wipes it from its tracking table, but the server at the other end
does not know that. When the server tries to close the connection
from its end, it sends a packet with this TCP flag sequence which
gets intercepted by the firewall.</font></p>

<p align=center><i>Setting up several screens on your Win/Lin box.</i></p>

<p><b>Must-read section</b></p>

<p>This article has been much inspired by a paper entitled 
&quot;Multihead systems&quot; (I think - I read the Spanish translation 
called &quot;Sistemas multihead&quot;) in Linux Journal, by Brian 
Gollsneider and Arthur M. Messenger. They're the guys to blame for 
getting me interested in this!</p>

<p>The &quot;X --help&quot; page ... worth browsing.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>About multiheading</b></p>

<p>As you people know, multiheading is all about hanging many screens 
on one computer. You can then either use the different screens to display
various parts of the same desktop, or different desktops. It has
been done with Unix systems since very  early on - around about when they
invented the X-Windowing system.  It can be useful when you tend to get a lot
of data on screen -- typical  examples are engineering (drawing and 3D
models) and system or network monitoring.</p>

<p>Its generalization is a bit more recent under Windows, though 
several video card makers have pushed the idea with dual-head cards. 
These are not necessary though; several ordinary video cards can 
play the trick.</p>

<p>In fact, one can mix many different kinds of ISA, PCI and AGP cards.</p>

<p>In this article, I will see how it works under Windows (98 version -
 though others should be the same) and Linux + XFree86 version 4. Please 
note that XFree86 version 3's configuration files are slightly different.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Considerations about hardware</b></p>

<p>The BIOS will choose one screen to be the primary screen.  This is
where your boot messages will appear and where you'll get the initial
console.  The BIOS looks for the primary screen on the following buses
in order:
<ul>
<li>the ISA bus</li>
<li>the PCI bus</li>
<li>the AGP bus</li>
</ul>

<p>ISA cards: if anybody still uses them, be warned they get 
preference before all others. Can still be useful for text 
consoles.</p>

<p>PCI cards. The PCI bus is a mixed thing, in the sense that 
you get both on-board devices and PCI cards all together. On 
most motherboards, it is a single bus numbered 0, with devices 
numbered 0:0 (host controller), 0:1, 0:2 etc. There can be 
sub-devices such as 0:9:1, 0:9:2, and so forth.</p>

<p>On-board PCI devices get the lower numbers, generally 
up to 0:7. Afterwards, devices 0:8 to 0:12 should be your 
PCI slots, numbered from the &quot;bottom&quot; of the motherboard 
in the direction of the AGP slot.</p>

<p>Almost all motherboards have only one AGP slot, though 
there is no technical reason why. It is identified as a PCI 
device on bus 1, as 1:0</p>

<p>For example, if you have one on-board PCI video card, one 
removable PCI and one AGP, your device ordering might be: </p>

<pre>
First (main) device:      PCI 0:6     (on-board)
Second device:            PCI 0:10    (removable)
Third device:             PCI 1:0     (AGP)
</pre>

<p>Other motherboard manufacturers set up the on-board video devices 
with higher numbers than the slots. This way, if your on-board 
video burns out (or you just want to upgrade), you insert a 
new PCI video card and its lower number gets preference at boot.</p>

<p>You can get detailed information on this under Linux, for 
example, this system has a single AGP card:</p>

<pre>cat /proc/pci

PCI devices found:

   (((snip)))

  Bus  1, device   0, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: Intel Unknown device (rev 33).
        Vendor id=8086. Device id=7800.
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 11.  Master Capable.  No bursts.  
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xce000000 [0xce000008].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xcfe80000 [0xcfe80000].

</pre>

<p>Another way (with root privileges) is:</p>

<pre>scanpci</pre>

<p>Please note that the order of cards is BIOS stuff -- and so applicable 
both to Windows and Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Configuration under Windows</b></p>

<p>This is meant to be pretty easy -- and is, except when you 
run into driver trouble. So I would advise you to start out 
by sticking *one* video card into your computer, then making sure 
you have the necessary drivers. Then go for the next card alone, 
and so forth. That way you get the pain in small pieces you can 
hopefully handle, instead of all at once.</p>

<p>When you are confident you have all the required drivers either 
on CD or on hard disk, and that they actually work with your cards, 
stick all the video cards in together and hang screens on them. Boot.</p>

<p>You will then get to reconfigure the drivers once more, one 
after the other. You may also get to reboot the computer -- but
you're used to that, right?</p>

<p>At this time, you should get the usual Windows desktop on your 
first (main) screen, and a text message on all others telling you 
that Windows has recognized the device correctly. If you don't, 
go back and reconfigure that video card correctly.</p>

<p>When you take a look at the screen properties, you should see
something like this:</p>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/screen1.jpg"></p>

<p>You then click on the number 2 screen, activate it, configure, 
and off you go. So forth for all others. Note that screens need not 
have the same resolution or color depth:</p>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/screen2.jpg"></p>

<p>Hopefully, you are then in business, and can drag windows 
from one screen to another. Try it!</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Configuration with XFree86</b></p>

<p>XFree86 version 4 has been changed in several ways from 
its version 3 predecessor. To begin with, the configuration 
file is now</p>

<pre>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</pre>

<p>Please note the -4 ending.</p>

<p>It has now dealt away with the antique separate server binary file
for each screen. We now have a more modern modular scheme with a 
single main server file, plus modules (drivers) for each family
of video cards. These can be found in most distributions in:</p>

<pre>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers</pre>

<p>This is similar to what has happened to the Linux kernel: from 
a monolithic kernel with all drivers included, modern kernels have 
progressed to a loadable modular scheme. Luckily for us.</p>

<p>Here's a list of the most-used drivers:</p>

<p><table border=1>
<tr><th>driver</th><th>cards supported</th></tr>
<tr><td>ati</td><td>most early ATI cards</td></tr>
<tr><td>r128</td><td>ATI Rage-128 and 128-based cards</td></tr>
<tr><td>cirrus</td><td>Cirrus Logic GD54??</td></tr>
<tr><td>cyrix</td><td>Cyrix Media GX CPU</td></tr>
<tr><td>i740</td><td>Intel 740-based cards</td></tr>
<tr><td>i810</td><td>Intel 810-based cards</td></tr>
<tr><td>mga</td><td>Matrox 100, 200, 400</td></tr>
<tr><td>nv</td><td>N-vidia Riva 128, TNT GeForce, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>s3</td><td>S3 non-Virge early PCI chipsets</td></tr>
<tr><td>s3virge</td><td>S3 Virge later PCI chipsets</td></tr>
<tr><td>vga</td><td>generic; replaces XFree86-SVGA</td></tr>
<tr><td>fbdev</td><td>generic; &quot;flat&quot; video memory mode</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>This system also means that it will be relatively easy for 
card manufacturers to produce their own modular drivers to support 
new cards. Let's hope that they do so.</p>

<p>Configuration is not complicated. The first part of the 
XF86Config-4 file should be pretty much self-explanatory, and is 
often rather well set up by your favorite distribution's setup 
program.</p>

<p><ul>The interesting parts are:
<li>the Monitor section, where you define actual monitors</li>
<li>the Device section, where you set up your video cards</li>
<li>the Screen section, where you give screen resolutions 
and color depths</li>
<li>the ServerLayout section, where you set up the relationships 
between screens</li></ul></p>

<p>In the Monitor section, each monitor gets its Section tag, such as:</p>

<pre>
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "monitor 1"
    VendorName "Philips"
    ModelName  "Unknown"

    HorizSync  30.0-64.0

    VertRefresh 50.0-110.0
EndSection
</pre>

<p>You can put in as many monitors as you wish, and name them. I 
usually call them "monitor 1" etc., as they are often of the same 
type and make. But you can handle this whatever way you feel 
most comfortable with.</p>

<p><strong>BE CAREFUL</strong> with the horizontal and vertical frequencies. 
You can literally blow up your tube if you are not careful. Been there,
done that :-( Get the right frequencies from the monitor's guide, or look them 
up on the manufacturer's site on the Web. If in doubt, go lower. Values that 
have worked out to be &quot;safe&quot; for me -- i.e. no screens blown up 
-- have been:</p>

<pre>
	HorizSync	31.5-35.5
	VertRefresh	50.0-70.0
</pre>

<p>Just about any modern multisync monitor can handle these -- however 
they are so conservative you won't be able to go far beyond 640x480 
with 8-bit color (256 colors). Just enough to prove the concept :-)</p>

<p>You then get to set up the driver for each video card. List 
the directory mentioned above. One Section for each card:</p>

<pre>
Section "Device"
    Identifier "device 1"
    Driver     "s3virge"
    BusID      "PCI:0:11:0"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "device 2"
    VendorName  "Unknown"
    BoardName   "Unknown"
    Driver      "i740"
    VideoRam    8192
    BusID       "PCI:1:0:0"
EndSection
</pre>

<p>In this case, I have one S3 card inserted in a PCI slot, and 
an Intel 740-based AGP card. With a single card, you do not need 
to look up and specify the bus ID (from /proc/pci). But in our case 
we need it to distinguish, for example, between several cards of 
the same type.</p>

<p>In the above example, if I added a second S3 Virge in PCI slot 
0:12, I would add a third Device section repeating the "s3virge" 
driver line, and specifying "PCI:0:12:0". The server is smart enough 
not to create two instances  of the driver in memory, just two references 
to the same driver.</p>

<p>As with monitors, the Identifier tag set up by the setup program 
usually contains the card's chipset commercial identifier, though 
you can change it at will.</p>

<p>You then set up a Screen section linking each Monitor to the 
appropriate Device. I strip this down to the essentials:</p>

<pre>
Section "Screen"
    Identifier "screen 1"
    Device      "device 1"
    Monitor     "monitor 1"
    DefaultColorDepth 16
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       16
        Modes       "1024x768" 
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "screen 2"
    Device      "device 2"
    Monitor     "monitor 2"
    DefaultColorDepth 24
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       24
        Modes       "800x600" 
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
EndSection
</pre>

<p>Finally, you set up the whole system:</p>

<pre>
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier "layout 1"
    Screen     "screen 1"
    Screen     "screen 2" RightOf "screen 1"
    Option "Xinerama" "on"

    InputDevice "Mouse1" "CorePointer"

    InputDevice "Keyboard1" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection
</pre>

<p>Here, I have screen 2 at the right of screen 1. I could also 
have specified it to be at the left, above of below any existing 
screen.</p>

<p>The Xinerama option is also important. This is an extension of 
the X server that links screen 1 with screen 2, to form a single 
desktop I can drag windows and icons across.</p>

<p>This works in the same way as Windows, but needs both (or all) 
screens to have the same color depth: generally 8, 16 or 24 bits. 
This means the above example shouldn't work! (Read it again to 
make sure you understand why before reading on.)</p>

<p>But you may prefer two screens with separate desktops. For example, 
you could have one screen for your own use, and make the other 
available over your local network. Or one screen with KDE and the other 
without any window manager. Your choice. This can be done simply by 
turning off Xinerama:</p>

<pre>
	Option  "Xinerama" "off"
</pre>

<p>Finally, you may prefer to keep a screen for the text console: 
include "screen 2", "screen 3", etc in your ServerLayout section, 
omitting "screen 1" (generally the console if where you boot from 
and where you get system error messages).</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Trying out XFree</b></p>

<p>As with Windows, it is best to start out by testing each 
video card individually. Start at the text console (runlevel 3).
Keep one screen in your ServerLayout, commenting out the others 
with a # at the beginning of the line.  You can then start up the 
X server (no need for a desktop yet):</p>

<pre>X</pre>

<p>You should get a black-and-white crisscross pattern, with an 
X-shaped mouse cursor in the middle. Good. You can shut down 
X and get back to the text console with</p>

<pre>Ctrl + Alt + Backspace</pre>

<p>Now do the same for the other cards. When you have everything 
set up, just uncomment all screen entries in ServerLayout, and 
test X once more. You should now get the crisscross pattern on 
all screens, and if you activated Xinerama, the mouse should move 
between screens.</p>

<p>&lt;smirk&gt;And you didn't need to reboot, did you?&lt;/smirk&gt;</p> 

<p>You can now either go directly into the graphical desktop 
with startx, or switch to a graphical login with runlevel 5:</p>

<pre>init 5</pre>

<hr>

<p><b>Comparison between Windows and Linux</b></p>

<p>As usual, there are differences between either way of doing 
things, and thus between the end results. To be objective:</p>

<p>- Windows lets you use devices with different levels of 
color and resolutions together as part of the same desktop. 
However, it cannot handle more than one desktop, nor can it
mix text consoles with graphics.</p>

<p>- Windows can be a pain to configure, with much rebooting.</p>

<p>- conversely, Linux can mix text screen with graphics -- this 
is great for keyboard-trained systems administrators --, can 
use more than one desktop, or can use all screens (or a 
combination of screens) for a single desktop. If you want KDE and 
Gnome at the same time, you get it. If you just want one single 
big WindowMaker, you get that. If you want to set up a 2x2 or 
3x3 video wall, all you need are enough cards, and enough slots
to set them in.</p>

<p>- If you want to mix screens with Xinerama under Linux, 
you need to use the same color depth on all of them.</p>

<p>- Linux with XFree86 version 4 is much easier to configure -- 
though maybe that's my bias showing through.</p>

<p>Seriously though, the last time I installed Mandrake 8.2, it 
detected all video cards and went multihead all on its own. Good 
show.</p>


<p>One last warning the reader may do well to heed: do this on 
a computer with backups up to date, not on a production machine. 
Video cards are tricky little things that can bite.</p>

<p>PS. Should anybody want to translate this article: I wrote it in
the spirit of  the GPL software licence. i.e. you are free (and 
indeed encouraged) to copy, post and translate it -- but please, 
PLEASE, send me notice by email!  I like to keep track of translations --
it's good for the curriculum :-)</p>

I finally changed the header and footer decorations as I've been meaning to
for months.  The main purpose was to shrink the vertical space the header
takes, to fit more of the article content on the first screenful.  This isn't
the last change; we'll make minor adjustments and maybe get a stylesheet one 
of these months.

term is "a target-rich environment", or "spoiled for choice." Often,
even words aren't necessary. }:&gt;

If the hardware clock's running slow, try heating up the case with a

The headers are similar to Klez in that the "From:" address is completely
different from the "From " address.  Unlike Klez, the ostensible domain
name in the last "Received:" header before it reached our server was not
a single word consisting only of random consonants.

... I saved the two messages in case it was the start of another

Of course, the funniest part is that the ostensible domain is so

Hey, all.
I'm going to be out of Net contact for a few days - I'm sailing up to
Cape Cod with a stop in New York. This means a couple of days AFK,
followed by a few back on, then about 4 off. If anybody's got an

Thanks.  The problem we had with the answerguy address was that a lot
of sites linked to it without explaining what it was for.

<P> Hmm, do you have "The Advice People" in your town?  It started several
years ago in New York and then and then one of the members established
it here in Seattle.  They set up a couple chairs and a sign certain
Friday and Saturday evenings in a pedestrian area (Broadway in Seattle)
and invite people to ask them any question they want.  They don't claim
to have any particular qualifications except "62 years combined
experience living on this planet".  The only topics they refuse to
discuss are politics and religion.  I don't remember whether they do it
for free or charge a token 25 cents.  Often a small crowd will gather
and listen to the questions and answers.
</P>
<P>
One year I was there the weekend before Halloween, and people would
ask for ideas on what to wear on Halloween.  The girl who was the 
coordinator came up with some original ideas like, "You could dress up as a
bowl of fruit.  Or maybe you could be a line of coke."
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure if they're still around.  I haven't seen them for a few
years.  I think there's a book written by the Advice People's founder, but I
don't remember the title or the author.

My name is Dr. Henrique Sessenou, a medical doctor and
the sole proprietor of the above specialist hospital.
I understand that through Internet is not the best way
to link up with you because of the confidentiality
which the transaction demands. However, I have already
sent you this same letter by post one month ago, but I
am not sure if it did get to you since I have not
heard from you, hence my resending it again. I have a
widow here in my hospital who is on a political
assylum in Lome - Togo refugee camp. She has 
been so ill for some couple of months now.

<P> This woman confided in me based on the free medical
attention I have been giving to her and her children.
She had revealed to me of her life history and about
her late husband who was a top military officer in one
of the west African country (Sierra-Leone) before his
death during the civil war and the fortune she
inherited from her late husband. She has asked me to
source a credible and trustworthy partner abroad who
will manage her funds for investment, the sum of
Twenty Eight Million US Dollars (US$28m) which her
late husband deposited in a safe fiduciary agent in
Europe through a security company based in Lome -
Togo. I wish to chose you for this venture and I
believe you will be in the position to assist in
managing this large sum in a profitable ventures and
also to help create a safe haven for her and her
children by making a residence arrangement for them in
your country.

<P> After she had disclosed this information to me, I saw
the reason to request from her all the documents
relating to this deposit of which she did, now I have
the documents covering the deposit which I will not
hesitate to fax to you the copies as a proof for your
confirmation as soon as I receive your response via
e-mail. I am obliged to assist this lady knowing too
well that she has a limited knowledge in the business
world and as such she cannot manage this funds
herself, and in order to avoid any trace of her by the
government, I will need from you a mutual
understanding and then we shall make plans on how the
funds would be secured into an account in your name;
after which you will arrange and travel immediately to
meet with the security company's Agency in Europe for
clearing.

<P> This amount is contained in a sealed trunk box and it
is registered and declared as containing family
treasures, so even as I am writing you now the
security company and its agency are not aware that
there is cash money in the trunk. Let me assure you
that this transaction is 100% hitch and risk free;
from my discussion with her, she has agreed to give
you a reasonable amount of percentage for your
involvement in this deal, and this has to be discussed
upon the receipt of your quick response.
