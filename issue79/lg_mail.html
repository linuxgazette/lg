I've seen the <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> site dealing with
genhdlist/genhddir,(<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/RedHat-CD-HOWTO-5.html"
	>http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/RedHat-CD-HOWTO-5.html</A>)
but is there a way to change the Red Hat installation gui to include a
customized set of RPM's? (something other than
custom/workstation/server)?  I'd like to try and bundle my own Linux
installation CD, but using programs that aren't included on the
standard install cd's, and still utilizing the Red Hat base
installation software.  Any suggestions?
</P>

I purchased an  eMachine to run Linux on.   It came with (sorry) XP which I
used to check out the
hardware.  It plays music CD's fine but uses digital data over the IDE buss
rather than a cable
from the CD drive to the sound input.
</P>
<P>
Loaded <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 7.3 and it plays sounds fine but it won't play music
CD's...the player just runs
and the CD spins along.
</P>
<P>
How do I configure the CD/sound system to pick up the digital sound data on
the IDE buss
to play the music?
</P>
<P>
Thank You,

Hi
</P>
<P>
I am running <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux 6.2 on an Intel server. The problem is
I cannot access Linuxconf over the web and my SWAt configuration
tool also does not run. The apache server is working fine. I have
a proxy connection  configured on my PC for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
How can I implement Acess Control Lists in Linux on the lines of
Solaris? If possible where can i get more info and necessary s/w
support?
</P>
<P>

<P>
What are Linux ramdisk fundamentals?  This spawns various
related questions below.  I could use some information to
fill the gaps in my understanding of the ramdisk processes
related to Linux startup.  I have successfully created
several RAM based Linux systems built from scratch and
using for reference the <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> boot/root floppy disk
layouts - that do not specify "initrd" to Lilo.
</P>
<P>
A mini-howto or full how-to may be useful as a guide for
developers of embedded linux and small custom systems.
</P>
<P>
Lilo can pass parameters to the kernel and the init process.
Does Lilo do the passing of parameters to "init" or does
the kernel pass the parameters from Lilo onto the "init"
process?  When does Lilo (boot.b) get out of the way and
allow things to happen?
</P>
<P>
I can find only scatterd documentation that explains how to
use ramdisk and initrd, but nothing on how to control the
side-effects of ramdisk usage between the kernel, lilo, and
init.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  initrd
  mkinitrd
  ramdisk
  pivot_root
  linuxrc
  init level changes (/etc/inittab)
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
What gets executed first (<TT>/linuxrc</TT> or the "init" process)?
Or do they try to operate in parallel? ugh! (MS/Windows
try to invoke many of the startup processes in parallel.)
</P>
<P>
When "initrd" is specified in "lilo.conf" and the Linux
kernel is configured for ramdisk support, and the system
is booted, what ramdisk image is loaded first or at all?
</P>
<P>
The "initrd" image or the kernel ramdisk image?
</P>
<P>
What programs are responsible for the loading the "initrd"
and "ramdisk" root images (kernel or LILO boot.d).
</P>
<P>
Note that the Linux kernel does not need LILO in order to
load a ramdisk from a second floppy using the same drive.
</P>
<P>
When is "pivot_root" an implicit process, and when must it
be explicitly invoked?
</P>
<P>
What is the difference between a LILO specified "initrd" and
the kernel specified ramdisk loaded as root?
</P>
<P>
Lilo can change and override some kernel default parameters.
</P>
<P>
Much of my experimenting is with "Linux From Scratch"
(<A HREF="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org"
	>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org</A>) as a basis to start from.
</P>
<P>
I have a fundamental problem understanding the relationships
between an "initrd" image, ramdisk root image, and the use of
<TT>/initrd</TT>, <TT>/linuxrc</TT>, and swap-root.  I am essentially trying to
create a memory-based portable Linux solution (without X) that
is loadable on multiple i86 (PC) architectures from floppy.
Each section, except for UTILDISK, I am wishing to have a
minimal set of products to implement the desired functionality.
This is for computers with many megabytes of memory, using no
hard disk.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  BOOTDISK    a floppy containing kernel and LILO boot products
  INITDISK    a floppy containing loadable modules
  ROOTDISK    a floppy containing a compressed root filesystem
              and a small set of utilities (i.e. busybox)
  UTILDISK    floppy disks containing useful utilities.
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
BootDisk Floppy: format "minix" mounted as "<TT>/fd</TT>"
Created as a LILO boot disk
</P>

<blockquote><pre>/fd/kernel.gz                    my kernel.gz (2.2.x, 2.4.x)
/fd/boot/message                 general message
/fd/boot/boot-text.b             boot with "message" file
/fd/boot/boot.b -&gt; boot-text.b   make default boot loader
/fd/boot/chain.b                 chain boot loader
/fd/boot/map                     lilo boot map
/fd/etc/lilo.cmd                 backup of lilo command file
/fd/dev/fd0                      device for loading ramdisk
/fd/dev/fd0u1440                 device for loading ramdisk
/fd/dev/null                     bitbucket device
/fd/proc                         is/not required for Lilo boot?
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I can successfully load a ramdisk as root using for sample
the Slackware bootdisk and rootdisk floppies, and then try
to create my own RAM resident Linux using Floppy Disks.
But the Slackware distributions do not mention "initrc"
in the "lilo.conf" files.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>Kernel Flags (rdev)
  root = /dev/fd0    = root device (or secondary ramdisk)
  use ramdisk        = true (load image into ramdisk)
  prompt for ramdisk = true (for ramdisk on second floppy)
  ramdisk offset     = zero (not on disk shared by kernel)
</pre></blockquote>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/wanted/hathaway.lilo.conf.txt">hathaway.lilo.conf.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Partial Ramdisk Directory for intermediate root system

Hej Answer Gang,
</P>
<P>
This is my third question in a short time. I hope you don,t get fed up.
All previous "problems" asked for has been nicely solved.
</P>
<P>
Q:
This question is about the fvwm95 WM handling. It is more of "cosmetic"
than functional nature.
Using Slakware 7.1 distribution with Linux kernel 2.2.16 for this set up.
Introduced a button in the "Button bar" that fires up an executable. That
works fine, but the "Button" in the bar then always shows "pressed in".
Clicking, for example, Xterm defined in the same "Button bar" always returns
the "button" as "not in". What controls this? Is it the return status from the fired
up executable, or is it defined somewhere in the fvwm95rc script or something else ?
Hoping for some nice advice, or any tip is welcome.
</P>
<P>
Best regard
<BR>Hans.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">fvwm95 is a fvwm-family window manager which has been tweaked to give the

I am using Mandrake 8.2.  I have recently installed a serial printer
using a Digi Classic-8 ISA card.  I have several terminals that use this
card without any problems.  I can print to this printer by using 'cat
{filename} &gt; <TT>/dev/ttyS11</TT>' and this works just fine, however I cannot get
lpr to print to this printer.  I think that my <TT>/etc/printcap</TT> file is
ok(I hope).  If anyone could point me in the right direction on this
problem I would greatly appreciate it!

If you did will you point me in a direction on how to setup a Linux server,
with internet access and e-mail serve, that are connected to two win98
machines. The Linux machine must dial on demand when one of the win98
machines want access to the internet.

Isn't the RedFlag caricature just a little racist?  Isn't it just a bit
condescending to have the Chinese Linux user portrayed as a myopic
pre-revolutionary peasant farmer with a cronic overbite?  Maybe it's
just me, but it doesn't seem like a great way to win new friends.

To offer a constructive alternative, in Chinese mythology, isn't there
some triad of great heros where one is a king, one is a soldier and
the other is a sombre scholar; I think these are the figures you see
in the shines at most Chinese restaurants -- the Scholar for the
RedFlag user seems a far more apropos choice than a rice-farmer

case where quoted printable mail is actually better than ascii text.

This is for non-american english speakers - several characters appear
as ascii 127 - 256 (extended ascii) which do not appear in pure
ascii.

<blockquote><FONT COLOR="#000066">
The annoyance factor of using it when you shouldn't, is that
mailers use QP equal signs everywhere instead of properly wrapping
their lines.  And they <EM>will</EM> wrap the words right in the middle

<ol>
<li> using QP when you don't need to, reduces your chance of

<li> <EM>not</EM> using it when you <EM>do</EM> need it, makes life harder on

your name's diacriticals wrong during publication time,

Yes, proper pound signs might count for that, too. If it's the
only odd character though, I think I might figure out from context
that it's not ... uh... whatever my current screen charset thinks
that is, and might be a british moneysign.

But in fact, we don't get scripts [destroyed by QP] sent to TAG.  
Nor do we get more
than a handful of non-English messages.    It really only comes up in people's
names, and they really should be ASCII-fying the name anyway becase that's the
only way to guarantee it won't be mangled (at least until all mailers, editors
and web browsers handle Unicode).  German, fortunately, has well-established
ae/oe/ue/ss to replace the non-ASCII characters.  With other languages you have
to wing it, but (1) ASCII-fication at the source saves the editors time because
they don't have to manually convert each high-byte character to the appropriate
HTML entity, and (2) those HTML entities don't show up right anyway on screens
using a different charset than the author did.  Some Latin-1 characters leak
through into <em>LG</em>, especially in From: headers, because we don't have time to
correct them all, but they will show up as who knows what on a Latin-2 or other
system.

To maximize your chance that the Gang will read your message, you should
send it in a form that doesn't force us to make any special efforts to
read your letter.  For example, word processing attachments are right out
(Word docs and PDFs, among others).  While a few mailers may read HTML or
automatically decode MIME text many people consider this "feature" a
problem instead and hit [delete] without a second glance - here are
<EM>instructions</EM> for turning them off.  (Note that we do our own HTML
processing so it does not help us to use your HTML version.) If you need
to send us a program or an image - rare, we can usually figure things out
by description - make an arrangement to upload it to us; the list tosses
out binary attachments and we would never see your mail!  Text attachments
are okay but inlines are better.  Quoted Printable is a special case - if
you are writing us in a foreign character set, we want to see your words
as you meant them. (It helps translation immensely.) But if you have no
special letters to defend, we really appreciate not having to run your
letter through the laundry to wash out stray = signs.

In this suggestion, 
I no longer mention vcards, and I no longer assume what foreign language
might be used - it's just about characters - in fact, if someone from the
norselands isn't using thorns and umlauts, I don't mind seeing their message
stay 7 bit too. I demand plaintext but I also tell people why - which I hope
will encourage them to meet the request.  Finally, for QP the point is so we
can understand them, and maybe this has a touch of humor, which is good too.
</P>
<P>
As for moneysigns I'm not afraid to go look up whether that squiggle was a
euro or a pound.  Although a two pence tip would still use a cent sign, no?
</P>
<P>
Fianlly - not about QP but for the FAQ - the ask-the-gang guidelines don't
warn people to expect a sense of humor.  Given the scorch marks from last
month, it probably ought to get mentioned.

There are a few included in your <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> pkg.  If you installed the susehelp

kdvi or xdvi.  Then run the viewer and point it to

LDP web site, have a look there.  Of course, the SuSE manuals are also
quite good, if they came with your purchase.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#006633"><EM>
As a general point, anything which has two whole three letter
extensions (.jpg.pdf, .mp3.scr, and so on) especially when the second
is one that may be reasonable to auto-view, you should be immediately
suspicious that it's probably a virus.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>

</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Nope, I meant it as I said it.  If the one on the end (the second
extension) is auto-viewable ... e.g. PIF, GIF, DOC ... then the other one
may be what it really is, or made up, or just trying to see if it can be
auto viewed as either one.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I'm afraid I still think that's the wrong way round. In the example to which
I was responding humor.mp3.scr is not an mp3. The first type is MP3, which it
would be reasonable to auto-view. I always thought the last (second in this
case) extension was what it really was (or at least, on a win box determines
how 'doze tries to launch it). This has the advantage for the virus writer
that the last extension may also be hidden, so the real type isn't always
seen by the viewer, e.g they may see "humor.mp3", which appears harmless.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Windows will launch the bits as they really are - thus the decision is not
about "is it really an MP3" ... which would give the media player a chance
to blow it off as a mangled sound ... but "shall I auto launch it"; if yes
go see the registry about it; the trojan gets to play puppydog in your rose
garden.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Note that if you told explorer to hide mp3 because you know what it is, and
you see mp3 anyway, then there was a doubled extension and you're not seeing
the one on the tail end.  We'll have to beware of this ourselves as Konqueror,
Evolution and other file-managers-on-steroids come to popularity in Linux.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Doubled extensions often hide the autolaunch decision and may give it two
chances to autolaunch.  I don't think anybody questions why I'm fond of Linux
for email instead.  While it's possible to configure Linux mailers to do all
sorts of crazy things, we don't currently have the registry mucking with our
concepts of what are and what aren't programs, or launchable.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
But with the kind exception of .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 nearly all other
double-tail filenames have been junk that ever came to my box.  And if the
last is not a compression sort (zip, gz, bz2, Z, sit, arj one time) usually
a trojan as well.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I agree totally with this bit.

A link to that page was sent to a mailing list that I am on because of all of

I assume by "mail relay" you just mean you want Sendmail to work, so you
can send mail from and to your computer. That's not a mail relay. A "mail
relay" means that your Sendmail program accepts mail *from non-local
senders to non-local recipients*. Normally, Sendmail accepts mail only if
it's <EM>from a local user</EM> or <EM>to a local user</EM>. Otherwise, you open up your
mail server for exploitation by spammers.
</BLOCKQuote></P><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Mail relay means no such thing.  You have described an <TT>/open/</TT> mail relay.  A
relaying MTA is <TT>/any/</TT> that accepts mail from non-local users and/or delivers
to non-local users.  Since we presently live in an age of smart clients
connected by the internet this describes almost all mail servers.
</P>
<P>
For oodles of examples of "relay" being used correctly in context see
<A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/tips/relaying.html"
	>http://www.sendmail.org/tips/relaying.html</A>.
</P>
<P>
It is also not true that most mail servers only accept mail that is from or to
a local user.  My ISP relayed this message to you from my notebook over SMTP.
It allows the relay because I am on the ISPs subnet, not because I have a
local account on the mail server.  This is typically what happens on a
corporate mail server as well.
</P>
<P>
That page at www.sendmail.org gives several examples of how your final
statement is untrue.  That list is not exhaustive, for instance SMTP AUTH and
POP-before-SMTP are both effective at stopping SPAMmers.

<P><strong>
just my two cents worth on the matter of a new layout...
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
i suggest that you DONT use flashy plugins like java or flash. too often i have seen online mags think they can look better by using these tools. i have yet to see it work. for people still stuck on the slow dialup connection, the plugins can be hell to download aswell...
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
stylesheets and plain old html work fine, in my opinion.

thanks.
