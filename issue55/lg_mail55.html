Subject: kppp playing up<br>
<br>
I'm running RedHat 6.0, with KDE as my user desktop and fvwm as
my root<br>
desktop.<br>
I have set up ppp and can activate it successfully through the
Network<br>
Configurator when logged in as root. When I go to my user
desktop, I can dial up my ISP (ClaraNET) and collect email, surf,
etc - providing I have already started the relevant apps. Once I
have logged on, I can't start new apps because kppp has (I think)
started playing with resolve.conf. If I go to a terminal and log
on as a different user, it says that my hostname is, e.g.
du-208.clara.co.uk, which is presumably my dynamic IP address. It
doesn't even reset it after I've logged off - I have to su root
and type<br>
&quot;hostname localhost&quot;<br>
before KDE will talk to me again. I'm know I've successfully set
up kppp in the past, but the various examples I've seen in books
tend to assume that your machine has its own name and IP address,
so I may have chosen some incorrect settings in kppp this time.
Can anyone help with the correct kppp settings for a plain
standalone box (localhost, 127.0.0.1) dialing on a regular phone
connection to an ISP that assigns a dynamic IP address?<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
Anne</p>

Hi,<br>
i'm running Red Hat 6.2 on a Pentium-MMX(233MHz.). i get crazy
problems with my keyboard... after i work with my computer for
about 20 minutes or so, i start missing keystrokes and sometimes
keystrokes are duplicated. then Linux throws this error at me: <br>
&quot;Keyboard: too many NACKs -- noisy keyboard cable?&quot;<br>
if i'm running X (i use KDE), and i exit, i see this message too:<br>
&quot;QGDict: Look: Attempt to insert null item&quot;<br>
it's so bad that i can hardly get any work done on my PC...<br>
the typematic rate setting option in BIOS is disabled - enabling
it and fiddling with the rates does not help either. i don't know
what's happening, could somebody please help!!!!<br>

Subject: RH Upgrade Problems<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
I am having a problem with my computer...<br>
I did an upgrade installation of Redhat 6.2 on my machine; which
now,after booting and loading Linux, would reach the text login
prompt, then supposedly Linux would start X11, but X11 never
appears, my screen is blank with some fuzzy, jagged white lines
flashing across my screen every<br>
few seconds. Ctrl+Alt+Backspace and Ctrl+Alt+F1-6 don't seem to
work as<br>
they normally do. Before I upgraded, I was happily running
Mandrake 6.0 (which is a beefed<br>
up version of RH as I understand) on my 166 Mhz, 64 MB Ram home
PC. If you know what the problem is and how to fix it, great, I
would like to hear from you! But even information on how to stop
X11 (if it is X11) from loading would be appreciated. Any other
ideas?<br>
Thanks,<br>
Michael Smith (mwdsmith@singnet.com.sg)<br>
<br>
P.S. Pls keep in mind that I have only been using Linux for 3 or
so months so am not an expert at everything.<br>

<br>
Hello,<br>
<br>
I was just having a quick look through your magazine and the
'answers guy' sections really intrested me,<br>
and prompted this question....<br>
So, I've always wondered about file formats for exe and obj
files. I guess there is all sorts of<br>
intresting data hiding away in there. Symbol tables, mark up info
and god knows what else.<br>
Is there some standard for these! Or is it completely compiler
dependant?<br>
<br>
Just out of interest, Paul.</p>

<br>
Hi,<br>
I'm quite new to Linux, but I want to learn as much as possible.
Here's my question (not really a problem, it would just be
interesting to find out how to do this):<br>
Lets say I do a 'finger' and heaps of users are spewed up onto
the screen. I only want to see the users which are preceeded with
the text 'potatoe'. So, I do the command 'finger | grep
&quot;potatoe&quot; ' .But, some users, for example tomatoe_man,
are connected to the computer
'potatoe.shellaccount.mycomputer.com', which means that they come
up<br>
aswell. Without making finger not display the 'Where' column, how
would I weed out these users?<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work on the gazette. <br>

Subject: linux crash <br>
<br>
dear sir,<br>
<br>
i would like to know if there is solution for the following
problem:<br>
when Linux crash due for example to an electric blackout, on the
next boot it tries to repair the file system (in this case the
hard disk has 2 partitions, on the 1st. the complete operating
system is installed, including boot, home, root etc., the 2nd.
partition is used for user programs files and database data.
Linux is RedHat 6.0 and Mandrake 6.0 (nad 7.0) but most of the
time it cannot repair and give a message like:<br>
<br>
** e2fsck cannot automatically repair file system. please do
e2fsck<br>
manually without the -a or -p options. **<br>
<br>
(type control-d to continue or type root passwd ..)<br>
<br>
here my questions:<br>
1- if one types control-d nothing happen (well linux tries to
repair but it finished as before..)<br>
2.- when manually repairing the file system a LOT of files are
lost, including important ones like inetd.conf, and not only on
this partition but on the 2nd. one. is this normal? . and what
can be done..<br>
<br>
this question is not really a problem but an option i would like
to have. do you know how to get the &quot;hour clock&quot; or
&quot;glass clock&quot; on KDE after doble clicking an icon on
the desktop. (like Corel Linux is doing with KDE )<br>
many thanks<br>

Subject: Second X server and Redhat 6.2/gdm<br>
<br>
Following up on Bob Hepple's tip on running a second X server, I
tried to to the same on my Redhat 6.2 box. I found that I could
start a new X server on the command line, but it gave me only the
basic X-server screen (fine grey check with the X cursor), and no
login screen. Same problem with Xnest.<br>
I could however run two X servers at once by placing a second
entry in the gdm.conf file and restarting gdm.<br>
It would be nice to only have the overhead when I want the second
server though. Any thoughts on how to get the login screen?<br>

<br>
Hi,<br>
I have setup the RedHat6.1 with sendmail 8.9.3. All the clients
use IMAP4 to connect to the server using Outlook Express 4.<br>
The problem I found is, there will be several processes for the
same user running the [imap]. As a result, the user cannot
receive or delete any mail in their mailbox. I have to 'kill' the
'extra' processes otherwise the mailbox will be read only. Is
there any thing I can do with this?<br>
Thanks!<br>

Subject: TERM Variable<br>
<br>
Hi,<br>
Hoping someone might have an solution for me. I have a Solaris
system<br>
with a number of Wyse 60 terminals connected to it. I have a
Corel Linux PC on a LAN with the same Solaris box. I believe I
have compiled the terminfo wyse60 entry correctly on the Linux PC
(as it did NOT have one originally).<br>
Basically I took the output from the command &quot;infocmp
wy60&quot; on the<br>
Solaris box and used &quot;tic&quot; to recompile it on my Linux
PC. So far so good. The entry is now in /etc/terminfo/w/wy60 and
&quot;infocmp wy60&quot; is identical to the Solaris one. I set
my TERM variable to wy60 but it doesn't look to healthy either
through an xterm session, a console text login or a telnet on
either. Any ideas? Am I going about this the wrong way? Basically
if I can get this working properly I can scrap Windows in favour
of Linux on all PCs on the LAN:) Thank you for any help you can
offer.<br>
-Timothy</p>

Subject: modprobe: can't locate module ppp-compress-21<br>
<br>
First I want to thank you and all the people at Linux Gazette for
all<br>
the fine work you are doing. Many of the services running on my
Linux box wouldn't be running without the help I've gotten from
your fine site.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming this is trivial, but it still bothers me. I've
usedSlackware, RedHat, and Mandrake distributions of the 2.2.x
kernel. I'm not sure which pppd version the Slackware and
Mandrake had but the RedHat has pppd 2.3.7. Iv'e use the
2.2.5,10,13,14,15 kernel revisions. With all of them I get error
messages when pppd starts:<br>

<pre>
Jan 15 17:54:40 paxman modprobe: can't locate module ppp-compress-21
Jan 15 17:54:41 paxman modprobe: can't locate module ppp-compress-26
Jan 15 17:54:41 paxman modprobe: can't locate module ppp-compress-24
</pre>

It doesn't matter if I'm calling my ISP or a friends Linux box so
I'm pretty<br>
sure that it isn't something that the other side of the
connection is requesting.<br>
I can't find any references to these modules in the kernel
documentation. ( using grep, I haven't actually read all the
kernel docs ). The closest thing to it that I see is the bsd_comp
module which loads without errors when the command &quot;modprobe
bsd_comp&quot; is executed. As near<br>
as I can tell, I don't have the modules that modprobe can't
locate.<br>
What am I doing wrong?<br>
What do I have to do to either get the modules in question, or to
tell<br>
pppd not to try to load them?<br>
Any help on this perplexing matter would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>

Subject: How to run Windows programs on Linux
<br>

<p>Whether or not Microsoft is successful in their appeal
to the US High Courts on technical grounds, the facts remain that after
a lengthy and involved legal process, they were found guilty of breaking
the laws of their country, and secondly of using their monopoly powers
to hold up innovation in what is still a developing industry.
<p>As a believer in religious principles, and the laws and
morals of my country, I find it unethical and personally abhorrent to continue
to use or recommend products and services produced by Microsoft.
<p>I recently read that Corel are using a Linux Windows emulator
to enable their Windows office suite to operate successfully in the Linux
environment without the need for any Microsoft products or services.
<p>Could you please let me and other concerned readers know
how to do this for other non Microsoft products, so we are no longer forced
to be immoral and unethical by association with a guilty party.

<P> Hi guys!

<P> In LinuxGazette 54 you printed under General Mail my eMail from 29 Apr 2000,
concerning my question for a german translation of LinuxGazette.
Today the new issue came out and I created a translation of the article
"Building a Secure Gateway System".
Hoping that more Linux guys will help me to translate more articles, I copied
it to my webpage.
The german LinuxGazette Mirror-Page can now be found under
<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.de">http://www.linuxgazette.de</A>.

<P> I hope that after my call someone will help me to get more and more
articles online.

<BR>Subject: Who controls the Linux Media ?

<P> I run <A HREF="http://www.linuxlinks.com">LinuxLinks.com</A> - a linux
portal and recently we added a personalised calendar service to our web
site. We submitted an article to LinuxToday (owned by internet.com) and it
was published only to be pulled almost immediately. The reason given was
that website enhancements are no longer news. However a similar service
offered by another website was published. And who owns that website ? Why
internet.com of course.

<P> OK, this calendar isn't state of the art - but it is a free service and it
does complement the existing facilities on the site. And sure, it is up to
LinuxToday what they think is newsworthy and so post. But wait a minute, 
this sort of thing has made the news before - linuxstart announced a similar 
calendar service - take a look at

<P> http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn99-07-13-015-10-PR

<P> What's the difference ? Well, Linuxstart are owned by internet.com

<P> This opens up a number of questions about how we judge the news we read.
Linux is becoming big business and there are vested interests. Web sites are
merging and being taken over by large conglomerates. Who determines the
impartiality of the news we read ? Who determines what is news and what is
advertising ?

<P> LinuxToday is one of the major daily linux newsites and they determine that
enhancements to major Linux websites like LinuxLinks is not important. But
LinuxLinks is independent - it isn't owned by internet.com and it isn't
owned by VA Linux. Is it and sites like it being penalised because they
don't have a monopoly in the Linux media ? And is this really in the spirit
of the Linux movement ?

<BR>Subject: Claims of First Indian OS: Aryabhatt Linux


<P> 			  Press Release<BR>
	 in response to articles on `Aryabhatt Linux' as<BR>
	       the first Indian Operating System.

<P> We introduce ourselves as the Linux Users Group, Bombay Chapter (<A
HREF="http://ilug-bom.org.in">ilug-bom.org.in</A>).  We are a non-profit
voluntary organisation actively involved in promoting open source software.
Our activities include mailing lists for users, training, workshops, open
source projects etc.  Our group constitutes more than 400 man years of Linux
experience vested in its members.

<P> We draw your attention to the  following articles which have
appeared in the publications mentioned below.

<P> 1. "Made-in-India Linux to go global", Express Computer dated
29/05/2000, page 1.

<P> 2.  "Linux Technologies launches Aryabhatt Linux", Times
Computing dated 31/05/2000 page 5.

<P> 3. "Aryabhatt Linux", PC Quest dated June 2000 page 174.

<P> ... and several others.

<P> In these articles there are numerous inconsistencies, false
claims and trademark violations made by the company Linux
Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  We have evaluated their Linux
distribution Aryabhatt Linux and compared it with other currently
available distributions such as Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake etc.
Listed below are some of the findings:

<P> 1. RedHat Trademark Violation?:  The packaging of Aryabhatt Linux
   distribution mentions that it is "Based on RedHat Linux 6.1",
   but fails to comply with RedHat's Licensing policy, as is
   evident from the following excerpt taken from
   http://www.redhat.com/about/trademark_guidelines.html

<P>    " C. You may state that your product "is based on Red Hat® Linux X.X,"
   but you must do so in a fashion that indicates that "Red Hat Linux" is
   not the name or brand of your product and that Red Hat is not a source
   or sponsor of your product. Some guidelines to follow on this point
   include:
   
<P>    " You must clearly indicate how your product differs from Red Hat®
   Linux. This includes listing the packages that you deleted from Red
   Hat® Linux and those that you added to your product, as well as
   indicating any and all other changes you made. This information must
   be clearly and prominently presented in all packaging, advertisements
   and other marketing materials for your product in a typeface no
   smaller than the typeface you use for the words "Red Hat® Linux."
   
<P>    " The use of "Red Hat® Linux" must be in a typeface (which includes
   appearance, size and color) no larger than one-third the size of the
   typeface used for the name of your product.
   
<P>    " The typeface you use for the words "Red Hat® Linux" must be the same
   typeface you use for other written text to describe your product. You
   may not use a unique typeface for "Red Hat® Linux" in order to set it
   off from the other text included on your product.
   
<P>    " You may not do anything at all to state or imply that your product is
   an official product of Red Hat, Inc. and may not do anything else to
   create confusion in the market between your product and the products
   of Red Hat, Inc.
   
<P>   " You must include the following statement in a prominent place in your
   product packaging and in all marketing and promotional efforts for
   your product:
   
<P>   "Red Hat® is a registered trademark of Red Hat, Inc. This product is
   not a product of Red Hat, Inc. and is not endorsed by Red Hat, Inc.
   This is a product of [name of publisher] and we have no relationship
   with Red Hat, Inc."

<P> 2. Linux trademark violation?: Linux is a registered trademark of
   Linus Torvalds who was the original developer of the Linux
   kernel. He has permitted use of this trademark subject to an
   explicit mention of his ownership. Neither their web site nor
   the product packaging mentions this fact.

<P> 3. It is not an original Indian Linux distribution: The Aryabhatt
   Linux is a distribution based on another Linux distribution
   viz Red Hat Linux 6.1 as mentioned on the product packaging.

<P> 4. Misrepresentation of License: Most of the programs distributed
   in Red Hat Linux are licensed as GPL (General Public
   License). This licensing policy permits anybody to go through
   the source code and modify as per their requirements. It also
   explicitly requires the GPL to be mentioned clearly. Arybhatt
   Linux does not seem to have been licensed under GPL since
   the GPL copy on the CD is issued by Red Hat and not by Linux
   Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

<P> 5. GPL requires distribution of source code as well as free
   download of source code: Under GPL it is mandatory to
   distribute source code FREE OF COST either on CD's or on ftp
   sites. As on date Linux Technologies has not made any
   provisions for the same.  The company also does not have any 
   ftp sites.

<P> 6. The Graphics Driver for SiS6215: Graphics Drivers for SiS6215 card
   were developed by SuSE GmbH (suse.com) and XFree86 (xfree86.org)
   and copyrighted under GPL. Linux Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
   falsely claims to have developed the same.

<P> 7. Misuse of Linux Logo: The Linux logo which depicts a penguin
   has been affectionately referred to for a long time as Tux by
   the entire Linux community. It also appears on most of the web
   sites, publications and articles pertaining to Linux. Other
   Linux distributions also feature Tux on their packaging. By
   writing Peggy across the penguin and registering it as their
   own trademark, Linux Technologies Pvt. Ltd. has attempted to cash
   in on the popularity of Tux and deeply hurt the sentiment of Linux
   users.
   	
<P> 8. The picture on product packaging box: The product packaging
   box as well as the step by step User Guide of Aryabhatt Linux
   depict a picture of peggy surrounded by networked
   computers. This picture was designed and copyrighted by
   Jassubhai Digital Media and was published in the August 1999
   issue of CHIP magazine, CHIP Linux special and Network
   Computing.
    
<P> 9. Most of the applications in any Linux Distribution are developed by
   GNU (www.gnu.org). Linux Technologies Pvt. Ltd. does not
   acknowledge the same.

<P> 10. Though Aryabhatt Linux is claimed as "customized for the
   Indian user", as on date, it does not support any Indian
   Language. And the claimed hardware support for the locally
   assembled hardware already exists in other distributions of
   Linux.

<P> 11. On going through the step by step guide, we found numerous
   inconsistencies and wrong information.

<P> As Indians we would love to have an Indian Linux distribution but
we are thoroughly disappointed and disgusted with Aryabhatt
Linux's blatant attempt to hijack the efforts of the open source
and free software community. This ruthless exploitation of free,
open source software will tarnish the image of the Indian
software industry. We therefore urge you to set the record
straight as regards the claims of Linux Technologies Pvt. Ltd., if you
have published articles related to Aryabhatt Linux.  For others who have
not published any reports, pleas consider this as information.

replies:</H4>

<P> It sounds like this company is violating the GPL in the use of some
FSF-copyrighted software.  If that is true, we can try to enforce the
GPL.  Would you please double-check for us that FSF-copyrighted
programs are included on their CD and on their ftp site, and send us
the names of the specific programs you identified?  We also need to
know the URLs and the official name of the product.

<P> Also, could you tell me how to contact them?  We need the company
name, snail addresses, email addresses, etc.  With this information,
we can have lawyers contact them to object.

<P> Meanwhile, one more item you can add to your list is that they're
calling the whole operating system "Linux".  Linux is actually the
kernel, one of the important pieces of the system.  That is what Linus
wrote in 1991.

<P> At that time, we had been working on the GNU operating system for
almost a decade, and it was almost complete enough for self-hosting;
the only major piece missing was the kernel.  Combining Linux with GNU
produced a complete free operating system, versions of which are now
integrated by Debian, Red Hat, and others.  Everyone is free to
redistribute it, but they ought to call it GNU/Linux and give us a
share of the credit.  It isn't a legal requirement, but it is the
right thing to do.

<P> See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html for more explanation.

<P> Regarding the idea of an "Indian operating system": I think that kind
of nationalism is not a good thing for world peace.

<P> But India should not feel left out.  The GNU system has been an
international project since the very beginning; no single country
originated it.  Humanity originated it.  And India is part of
humanity.
