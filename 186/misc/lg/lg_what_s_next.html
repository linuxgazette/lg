<p>
Hello, all -
</p>

<p>
After a number of years of running LG, I've reached a stopping point: I
can't continue producing it, for a variety of interconnected reasons. In
short, the group of people currently involved in making LG happen has
become so small that almost the entire thing has fallen on me - and the
technical side of producing it is so complicated that my current level
of business and other life involvement does not leave me with enough
spare time to do it. As a result, there was no LG issue for this month -
and despite giving it my best shot over the past two weeks, I have still
not managed to release one.
</p>

<p>
That seems to me to be an extraordinarily clear signal that the time has
come for me to step down. Whether that means that someone else gets to
take over, or whether LG simply ends at this point, I don't know. I've
tried to prevent the latter... but it appears that I have reached the
end of what I can do in that regard. Whether it continues or not has to
become someone else's concern. I am no longer able to carry the load.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that someone with better management skills than mine could
organize and structure a working team that would distribute the load;
someone with more time could replace the totally outdated and rather
arcane production system, which currently takes many hours of work to
release an issue (by contrast, a CMS such as WordPress could easily be
configured to replicate the LG site structure, and production - as well
as adding proofreaders and editors - would become a trivial matter
rather than the complicated and fragile SVN-based system currently in
place.) I would be happy to advise whoever takes over, assuming that
someone does.
</p>

<p>
The current state, however, is that LG is no longer being actively
produced by me. My most sincere apologies to anyone that I have let
down.

I've been expecting this, and I fully understand. I've been trying to put
some of my resources into the editing process, but frankly I failed due to
my workload and other events.

<p>
I suggest we use your e-mail as a basis and publish this as LG issue. We
may not have articles then, but at least it is clear to everyone what
happened.
In the past you've sent warning signals out, calling for volunteers. We
tried to put the editing process on a broader basis, but it didn't work
out.

<p>
You haven't let down anyone; on the contrary, without you the LG would
probably have ended much sooner. I wont't forget that and tell everyone who
asks. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; Hello, all -

<p>
Hey Ben,
</p>

<p>
sorry to hear - but thanks for your great work and all the effort you've put 
into LG! I think we all understand - so no hard feelings.
Thanks!
</p>


<p>
What I was wondering since I read your email - how many readers/page 
impressions does LG currently have?
Because if there is a broad readership then continuing LG (as LG 2.0 or LG 2.6 
;) would perhaps be an idea worth considering.
</p>

<p>
Using an CMS like wordpress, serendipity or typo3 would easen the life of the 
authors and proofreaders perhaps and also unburden the editor in charge.
I know that typo3 offers a whole workflow for publications, but I think the 
others would do it as well.
</p>

<p>
Ben, can you tell me perhaps where LG is currently hosted and how much this 
costs on monthly average?
</p>

<p>
I was also wondering how many people on this list would like to contribute 
further to LG (under a new leader)
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Peter

I remember when we had to move away from SSC.  One of the reasons for that

<p>
I can't blame you Ben. I've grown to appreciate the work you do with
LG, and over the past 15 months or so it has inspired me to help as
much as I could, but probably not as much as I should have.
</p>

<p>
I do think the idea of maybe moving LG to something where people can
contribute in a more social like environment interesting.
</p>

<p>
Maybe a combination of Twitter and Facebook where people can post 2
cents tips to the wall. Or maybe move it towards a 'forum' like style
with different threads, and a 'community' built around it.
</p>

<p>
All of it requires work though, so the catch-22...

That makes sense. I've actually got several articles that I'd like to
push out to the world before it's all over - that was one of the things
that made giving up such a bitter pill. I <em>should</em> be able to scrape up
enough spoons [1] to put out one last issue, say on the first of the
upcoming month... but that's my limit.

Between the number of unique IPs in the server log, Alexa's popularity

couple of hundred to a couple of million. Personally, I'm confused as
hell, and have no clue. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Yep; I agree. A while ago, I put together a template for it under
WordPress, and it took less than half an hour to set up from scratch.
Issues as categories, editors and proofreaders given accounts with
appropriate levels of access, and making categories private by default
and public when you want to go live - bingo, it's all there. Nice and
easy.

&gt; I know that typo3 offers a whole workflow for publications, but I think the 
&gt; others would do it as well.
</pre>

<p>
I tried out typo3 a while back on my system, and found it very complex
as far as configuration goes. I also couldn't figure out a reasonable
workflow, so I gave up on it - but I will note that I really enjoyed its
very clean and precise interface. Perhaps if I'd stuck with it, it would
have started making sense sooner or later.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Ben, can you tell me perhaps where LG is currently hosted and how much this 
&gt; costs on monthly average?
</pre>

<p>
I'm hosting it at my VPS. If someone wants to continue it, or set up a
CMS (or whatever), I'll be glad to continue hosting it - no charge.

<p>
It wasn't so much about using a CMS as making it a free-for-all, without
editing, proofing, or any other type of review. SSC basically wanted to
make it into a blog so that they wouldn't have to put in any more
effort into it.
</p>

<p>
Well, I managed to keep it going for almost another five years past that
point - good grief, it <em>has</em> been quite a run, hasn't it? - and I'm
certainly not giving up due to lack of interest. Many people will miss
it if - or when - it's gone.

Hi ,
  I think everyone has not that much time as before.
  I have enjoyed the issues of LG i have read, i thought I was very
lucky by finding a place that people so knowledgeable speak so freely
about the things they know, linux or any other thing.
   I would love to see continue the mailing list but i don't know if
that is a lot of effort for you.
   I  don't think you have let anyone down.
   Take a break, relax and if you find you want to share thoughts or
news or anything i don't mind at all to hear from you.
    It's been nice to hear from you all.
     Sorry if my english is not so good.
     Josep Manel
</p>

<p>
 Now I am teaching tecnology and computers more than doing any work
directly involved with industry but anyone that wants help ask
directly and would try to help.

You've been great, actually. Between the Social Media stuff and your

<p>
Hi Ben,
</p>


<p>
I join all the others who thanked you for all your work for LG over
the past many years. On a personal note, I'd like to thank you for all
you have done for me and for all you have taught me. I came in brashly
believing I could write. Without crushing my delicate ego, you allowed
me to aim for much better. If I have failed to improve, I bear full
responsibility.
</p>

<p>
All this leads me to make a suggestion. I hasten to add that I
understand that suggesting what other people should do is cheap, but I
ask that you hear me out.
</p>

<p>
Let me quote you (my emphases):
</p>


<p>
--&gt;After a number of years of RUNNING LG, I've reached a stopping point: I
--&gt;can't continue PRODUCING it, for a variety of interconnected reasons. In
--&gt;short, the group of people currently involved in making LG happen has
--&gt;become so small that almost the ENTIRE THING HAS FALLEN ON ME - and the
--&gt;TECHNICAL SIDE OF PRODUCING IT is so complicated that my current level
--&gt;of business and other life involvement does NOT leave me with ENOUGH
--&gt;SPARE TIME to do it.
</p>

<p>
--&gt;I'm sure that someone with better MANAGEMENT SKILLS than mine could
--&gt;ORGANIZE AND STRUCTURE a working team that would distribute the load;
</p>

<p>
--&gt;        I would be happy to advise whoever takes over, 
</p>


<p>
--&gt;The current state, however, is that LG is no longer being actively
--&gt;PRODUCED by me.
</p>

<p>
--&gt;* Ben Okopnik * EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, Linux Gazette * <a href='http://LinuxGazette.NET'>http://LinuxGazette.NET</a> *
                   ===============
</p>

<p>
What all the above says to me is that you have carried too many roles.
For far too long.
</p>

<p>
If it were possible, here's what I'd like to suggest. Take away from
you all the mechanical and administrative tasks which you have been
performing (seemingly, on your own). These are tasks in which you are
not uniquely gifted. These all relate to the PRODUCING (or publishing)
of LG. Also, take away from you the lower level journalistic tasks
like proof-reading.
</p>

<p>
I would leave for you the title and role that I suspect you hold dear,
a role you perform uniquely well: Editor-in-Chief, Linux Gazette.
</p>

<p>
If anyone out there is under the illusion that all an editor does is
put commas where the idiot author had semicolons, then LG is lost
already.
</p>


<p>
I have been delighted to see some of my articles published by Ben. By
the same token, I have a directory full of articles which, for one
reason or another, were rejected by Ben. (In some cases, he
diplomatically left the left the final decision to delay or modify up
to me.)
</p>

<p>
	It's the fish that John West rejects
	That makes John West the best
</p>

<p>
		- (probably misquoted) advertisement
</p>

<p>
If anyone and everyone is allowed to publish articles in the New LG,
it's probably true that NLG will have more articles. But what about
quality? I could get all my irrelevant, unrelated, off-topic articles
published; all my rants; all my wrong-headed, incorrect drivel (<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">.
</p>

<p>
But, I suspect that, as the quality falls off, the value of NLG will
gradually decrease - more noise, less signal - until it ceases to be
relevant.
</p>

<p>
I have some other thoughts, but I have gone on for far too long
already.
</p>


<p>
Ben, I don't know that you want to continue as Editor-in-Chief. I hope
I have not put unreasonable pressure on you.
</p>


<p>
--&gt;My most sincere apologies to anyone that I have let down.
</p>

<p>
Again, I echo all those who say you have let no one down. We all could
see this coming. If anything we have collectively let you down.
</p>


<p>
Regards and Thanks,
Henry

I agree with Henry here. LG would be *less fun* without you. Don't just
disappear is all I'm asking... stay with whatever you could manage easily.
You have <strong>not</strong> let anyone down. Volunteers like myself have let LG down.

Few weeks ago I was working on a site and the PageSpeed was telling me to
optimize images by losslessly compressing them. I did not know about this.

&gt; of LG. Also, take away from you the lower level journalistic tasks
&gt; like proof-reading.
&gt; 
&gt; I would leave for you the title and role that I suspect you hold dear,
&gt; a role you perform uniquely well: Editor-in-Chief, Linux Gazette.
</pre>

<p>
That was what I'd tried to do, and to build, while running LG - and
failed. The reason is immaterial now, but the result, inevitably, was to
exhaust my own resources. Perhaps someone else, with fresh motivation
and more team-building ability, will succeed.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Ben, I don't know that you want to continue as Editor-in-Chief. I hope
&gt; I have not put unreasonable pressure on you.
</pre>
 
Not at all. I had put off quitting while I had doubts about it, and quit
when I no longer had any doubts.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; --&gt;My most sincere apologies to anyone that I have let down.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I echo all those who say you have let no one down. We all could
&gt; see this coming. If anything we have collectively let you down.
</pre>

<p>
Thanks, Henry. I honestly do not feel that any of you have let me down
in any way; I'm sincerely grateful for all the help that I got.
</p>

&gt; Hi ,
&gt;   I think everyone has not that much time as before.
</pre>

<p>
That may well be true - although that's not the key problem in my case.
It does contribute to it, though.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;   I have enjoyed the issues of LG i have read, i thought I was very
&gt; lucky by finding a place that people so knowledgeable speak so freely
&gt; about the things they know, linux or any other thing.
</pre>

<p>
That's an environment that I <strong>loved</strong> fostering here. Nowadays, though,
there's a number of other places where that holds true - even with
regard to Linux.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    I would love to see continue the mailing list but i don't know if
&gt; that is a lot of effort for you.
</pre>

<p>
It's not any effort, really - but... TAG, without an LG in which to pub
the discussions, is not viable. It needs an environment, a structure
around it, that will give it meaning. Perhaps recreating some form of it
on Facebook, as has been suggested here, would work well.
</p>

<p>
The main purpose of TAG up to this point was to answer the readers'
questions; without readers, that purpose is lost. It would be great if
TAG could be preserved in some form - it's a group that consists of some
great, knowledgeable people. Aristotle was right; the whole is indeed
greater than the sum of its parts, and this group is an excellent
example. I'd hate for that to dissipate into thin air.

Well, assuming that someone takes over LG - and no one has come forward

I'd be happy to hang around. I don't want LG to end... but I do need to

&gt;&gt; Ben Okopnik &lt;ben@linuxgazette.net&gt; said:
</pre>

<p>
B&gt; After a number of years of running LG, I've reached a stopping point: I
B&gt; can't continue producing it, for a variety of interconnected reasons.
</p>

<p>
   It's not like we weren't warned, but let's look at this like a nasty
   programming problem.
</p>

<p>
B&gt; [A]lmost the entire thing has fallen on me -
</p>

<p>
   Distribute the load so the system will scale properly.
</p>

<p>
B&gt; and the technical side of producing it is so complicated that my current
B&gt; level of business and other life involvement does not leave me with
B&gt; enough spare time to do it.
</p>

<p>
   Release early and often, do the simplest thing that can possibly work.
</p>

<p>
B&gt; [R]eplace the totally outdated and rather arcane production system,
B&gt; which currently takes many hours of work to release an issue
</p>

<p>
   For now we dump some features that look neat but are just taking too
   much time to implement/maintain.  I think the next part's the fix:
</p>

<p>
B&gt; A CMS such as WordPress could easily be configured to replicate the LG
B&gt; site structure, and production - as well as adding proofreaders and
B&gt; editors - would become a trivial matter rather than the complicated and
B&gt; fragile SVN-based system currently in place.
</p>

<p>
   WordPress is certainly capable enough to use for a complete CMS, and
   it would make a great base for LG 2.0 as long as someone keeps an eye
   on the security; PHP has an all-your-eggs-in-one-basket security model,
   which is tolerable as long as you watch the basket.
</p>

<p>
   If you want to see how WP can serve as the engine behind a good group
   site, have a look at <a href='http://www.bookwormroom.com/'>http://www.bookwormroom.com/</a>.  Disclaimer: it's
   a political site, but ignore the articles and look at the arrangement.
   You have one main owner/editor/den-mother[1] with a "Watcher's Council"
   of supporters, many of whom post at irregular intervals.  There's never
   a shortage of content, and the site looks very professional.
</p>

<p>
   Other advantages to keep your workload down:
</p>

<p>
   * Comment-spam crap can be kept to a minimum by using tested plugins and
     allowing post by email, so you can use your existing mail filter:
     <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_by_Email'>http://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_by_Email</a> has details about procmail
     and qmail setups, etc.
</p>

<p>
   * The WP account system supports an editor with God privileges plus
     additional contributors.  <a href='http://www.grahamazon.com/wordpress-as-cms/'>http://www.grahamazon.com/wordpress-as-cms/</a>
     describes a setup where the admin user approves posts; basic users
     can post new projects and edit old ones, but when they click "save",
     the post becomes a draft.  This way we can avoid the potential quality
     decline I've seen mentioned; the editor <strong>edits</strong> instead of worrying
     about production details.
</p>

<p>
   * Handle search, event calendars, page links, and contact forms:
     <a href='http://blueprintds.com/2008/03/13/top-10-wordpress-cms-plugins/'>http://blueprintds.com/2008/03/13/top-10-wordpress-cms-plugins/</a>
</p>

<p>
   * Static home page option, future posts calendar, role management, and
     easier admin publishing menus:
     <a href='http://wpgarage.com/wordpress-as-cms/10-plugins-that-will-make-wordpress-into-a-cms/'>http://wpgarage.com/wordpress-as-cms/10-plugins-that-will-make-wordpress-into-a-cms/</a>
</p>

<p>
   * Dynamic content, Category templates (PHP examples instead of plugins):
     <a href='http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/wordpress-theme-hacks/'>http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/wordpress-theme-hacks/</a>
</p>

<p>
   * Allow a more complex hierarchy of pages suitable for LG, create a sitemap:
     <a href='http://apeatling.wordpress.com/2006/11/23/five-wordpress-cms-enabling-plugins/'>http://apeatling.wordpress.com/2006/11/23/five-wordpress-cms-enabling-plugins/</a>
</p>

<p>
B&gt; My most sincere apologies to anyone that I have let down.
</p>

<p>
   You've let nobody down; LG has been on my must-read list for <strong>years</strong>.
</p>

<p>
   If LG moves to something like this, do you lose the ISSN number?  Jakob
   Nielsen has a blog but managed to keep his:
   <a href='http://www.useit.com/alertbox/search-strategy-example.html'>http://www.useit.com/alertbox/search-strategy-example.html</a>

Tthis may work. We already have an excellent group of writers. It will be
just like a blog (?) and the writers can publish articles whenever they have
something new to share. We can have other categories like TAG, News Bytes,

<p>
I don't think that it is the case that you didn't manage to carry it
off - more that the
Linux environment changed. Distibutions are much easier to install, hardware
has better support and there are more locations to go to for help if
you are stuck.
</p>

<p>
Also I consider that LG is a forum for expertise - the articles are of
a consistently
high standard and TAG often has very interesting conversations that roam over
many aspects of Linux use not covered elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
It hasn't failed - it is just too burdensome for one man to keep doing
alone. It needs a team,
built around a different editor to give you the rest you need. I'd
hate to see you
leave LG entirely though - you have been such a vital part for so
long, perhaps a guest
editor slot would suit?
</p>

<p>
Best,
</p>

The technical problems in running LG (and yes, I understand that this is
peripheral to what you're talking about; I'm just drawing a parallel
here) are/were all surmountable. Most, in fact, have been handled, at
least within the context of the old system. The remaining problems were
all social in nature: whether through lack of time (and that was a major
factor) or through lack of ability in that area, I was unable to
"capture the hearts and minds" of the kind of people that were needed as
LG staff. That's not to say that a number of people didn't help along
the way; quite a few did. The problem is that no one seemed interested
in getting involved in the process of running LG itself, in working with
the system behind the tasks.
</p>

<p>
The worst part of the above, for me, is the feeling that I should have
been able to do something - I don't know what, but <strong>something</strong> - to
change that.
</p>

<p>
(Given all the UFO reports, <em>surely</em> there's a Human Reference Manual
somewhere out there by now (other than "How to Serve Man"); all you have
to do is learn Betelgeusian or Perseid or whatever, and find the right
bookseller. Just as surely, though, there <em>isn't</em> one for human social
groupings. Way too many variables. Yet, somehow, some people manage.
They're the ones in the history books.)
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; B&gt; [A]lmost the entire thing has fallen on me -
&gt; 
&gt;    Distribute the load so the system will scale properly.
</pre>

<p>
Yes, that would do it. Once there was a staff willing to carry the load,
that is.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; B&gt; and the technical side of producing it is so complicated that my current
&gt; B&gt; level of business and other life involvement does not leave me with
&gt; B&gt; enough spare time to do it.
&gt; 
&gt;    Release early and often, do the simplest thing that can possibly work.
</pre>

<p>
That's been the /modus operandi/ for a while now. One man couldn't
possibly handle all the tasks otherwise.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; B&gt; [R]eplace the totally outdated and rather arcane production system,
&gt; B&gt; which currently takes many hours of work to release an issue
&gt; 
&gt;    For now we dump some features that look neat but are just taking too
&gt;    much time to implement/maintain.  I think the next part's the fix:
</pre>

<p>
If you see any, please point them out. As it is, the previous point
covers the "neat but not strictly necessary" features: AFAIK, there
aren't any.
 
In any case, all of these suggestions - useful as they are in themselves
- miss the key problem I've detailed above. Hopefully, they'll be of
help to whoever decides to carry LG forward... assuming that such a
person exists.

&gt; Tthis may work. We already have an excellent group of writers. It will be just
&gt; like a blog (?) and the writers can publish articles whenever they have
&gt; something new to share. We can have other categories like TAG, News Bytes,
&gt; HelpDex etc.
</pre>

<p>
The thing that made LG different - and, at least to my mind, it was a
difference worth preserving - was that it focused on peer-reviewed,
regularly-released content. That's what made it stand out from the
multitude of Linux blogs out there, and what created the <strong>reason</strong> for
that excellent group of writers to submit their articles to LG rather
than just publishing them in their own blogs. I strongly suspect that
going to a blog format would lose a large number, if not all, of those
writers.
</p>

<p>
<em>This</em> aspect of switching to a CMS was one of the reasons that we split
from SSC.  There were other, even bigger ones, but the switch to
"publish at will" was a large piece of the whole: it was a clear signal
that SSC didn't want to "waste their time" on LG any longer, and would
let the crowd have their bread and circuses... and we all know how that
approach ended for Rome.
</p>

<p>
(From that perspective, I guess I'm Sulla; in a small way, I I aimed for
similar goals and got similar results. Maybe I didn't have his vision or
his ability, but then, few men did - and I didn't send out any death
squads, either. And "non melior amicus, non nequior hostis" is pretty
apropos as well.)

&gt; I don't think that it is the case that you didn't manage to carry it
&gt; off - more that the
&gt; Linux environment changed. Distibutions are much easier to install, hardware
&gt; has better support and there are more locations to go to for help if
&gt; you are stuck.
</pre>

<p>
Yep. I realized that, and tried to focus on a direction that would
emphasize the value of LG even in that environment. This, perhaps, would
be the best area to explore if someone wanted to revitalize LG: what is,
as the sales folks say, the value proposition here? What does LG offer
that other Linux resources do not?
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Also I consider that LG is a forum for expertise - the articles are of
&gt; a consistently
&gt; high standard and TAG often has very interesting conversations that roam over
&gt; many aspects of Linux use not covered elsewhere.
</pre>

<p>
Exactly the key factors that I tried to maintain and sharpen.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; It hasn't failed - it is just too burdensome for one man to keep doing
&gt; alone. It needs a team,
&gt; built around a different editor to give you the rest you need. I'd
&gt; hate to see you
&gt; leave LG entirely though - you have been such a vital part for so
&gt; long, perhaps a guest
&gt; editor slot would suit?
</pre>

<p>
Gladly. Whatever technical expertise or advice I can provide (to be
taken with a large grain of salt, of course), time permitting.

The referent in English is a slippery beast that is easily spooked; it

at all. Since Ren&eacute; was explicitly addressing the problem of the <em>human</em>

reason for stepping down - all of the above terms refer to the people
who would volunteer to do the above tasks rather than the software or
the equipment (which, as I've mentioned previously, I'd be happy to

<p>
But I'm not at all surprised at your missing it; most people in this
milieu don't tend to think in those terms. It's like a different
language, with an utterly different mental map.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently working my way through an audiobook, a Russian rendition
of Lion Feuchtwanger's "Der Falsche Nero". Given that it's Feuchtwanger,
it is (of course) brilliantly researched and masterfully written -
strong wine indeed - but the point I wanted to underscore here is that
the story of Terentius' ascent to power is <em>all</em> about the human factor
and those who understand the true nature of that power. A different
language indeed.

I do hope that everyone takes this as the call to arms that it is.
Folks, if you don't respond, LG is a dead letter. If that's what you
choose, then fine - but please don't let it happen through automatic
passivity; if you choose not to decide, you are deciding - and you're
casting a vote for the death of LG. And thinking "oh, but I only have a
little time to contribute, and I'm not all that skilled..." is another
choice that ends the game: if you have <em>anything</em> to contribute, it
would be useful. If it doesn't get used, then that's a failure at the
staff level - but at least <em>you've</em> voted for LG to live by offering
your effort. That's a big difference.

And this is the <strong>best</strong> kind of response, bar none. Stating both what you
can offer as well as your limits is the best kind of info for
coordinating an effort. Do we have any more volunteers? Especially, do
we have any volunteers who would be good at coordinating this effort,
either by themselves or as part of a coordination team?

My time is pretty seriously circumscribed these days, but I can
definitely offer whatever expertise I've gained in my time as EiC. If I
focus on my areas of competence and watch my time carefully, I should be
able to provide both staff and technical expertise. Proofing is too
