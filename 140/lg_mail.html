Hi all,
</p>

<p>
The latest issue (<a href="../139/index.html">http://linuxgazette.net/139/index.html</a>) of LG has a
new feature - a "Digg this!" button (as you must have noticed it). I
am looking after this sub-project. I would like to get some feedback
about this as to how to improve it; or any modifications /suggestions.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,

<p>
I have searched the net (google, newsgroups ...) to find an answer to
this question .- but without success.
</p>

<p>
In KDE (for example) you can get individual desktops backgrounds for
each virtual desktop.
Well - i am used to a utility for M$-Windows called Xdesk that also
can set the the desktops to have individual icons / folders.
</p>

<p>
I know that in the windows world they change a regkey that tells where
the desktop belongs for each switch so such a 'true virtual desktop'
</p>

<p>
I have also in M$-Windows created bathc-files to use with less
intelligence window-managers, theese batch-files separately update the
regkey to get my own way to create 'true virtual desktops'
</p>

<p>
Is there any program that i can get to have different desktops-folders
or is there any way  to trick either  kde / gnomw / idesk to have
different desktops?
</p>

<p>
I suppose it should go with renaming the main folders there they save
the desktop-information for each switch, so the desktop you are on
have specific icons and settings, and then force kde /gnome / idesk /
whatever to update.
</p>

<p>
And yes - i know that the folder layout differs for Kde / Gnome /
Idesk / Whatever - i am satisfied with a solution that fits one of
theese or maybe someother Desktop Manager (for example XFCE4)
</p>

<p>
sorry for the length of the letter - feel free to strip out whatever
you like to make it place in the list.

<p>
   MI/X for Macintosh
   A Professional, Free X Server.
</p>

<p>
   Mac computers run the TNT products <a href="http://www.microimages.com/index.htm">http://www.microimages.com/index.htm</a>
   through the unique MicroImages X Server (MI/X), which MicroImages supplies
   with every TNT product for Macintosh.
</p>

<p>
   MicroImages is also pleased to make this X Server freely available for
   Macintosh users who do not have any of the TNT products. You may want to
   use your Power Macs as X terminals in a network environment -- MI/X works
   fine as an X terminal emulator. You may also want to make your PC a true X
   Server and run multiple X clients from your desktop. MI/X works fine
   there, too -- after all, that's why MicroImages developed MI/X in the
   first place.
</p>

<p>
   If you can configure a telnet session, you know enough to use MI/X. Since
   MI/X for the Macintosh is made freely available, MicroImages cannot
   respond to individual user requests for technical support. However,
   MicroImages maintains MI/X as the X Server for its line of TNT
   professional products <a href="http://www.microimages.com/index.htm">http://www.microimages.com/index.htm</a>, so you will
   find MI/X a stable and robust performer.
</p>

<p>
   If you have any questions comments or suggestions regarding MI/X for
   Macintosh contact us at mix@microimages.com

   User Reviews
</p>

<p>
   A free X Window server for Power Macs. It's got all the requisite features
   - host allow/deny, background configurability, etc. - and comes with twm,
   although you can use any other window manager.
</p>

<p>
   "Although it was not as easy to configure as come commercial X server
   software, I was connecting to our UNIX server relatively effortlessly.
   It's a great tool to have in our computer lab to connect to the
   workstation for one of our research projects." - Jiro Fujita
</p>

<p>
   "This is an amazing piece of software - especially considering the price.
   MI/X performs well on my 7200/90 and is very much easier to set up and use
   than MacX or its reincarnation, Xoftware. I noted a few minor bugs with
   screen redrawing when using the backing store but on first impression this
   seems to be a useful and usable X-server." - David Robertson, Programmer,
   Department of Computer Science, University of Otago

<p>
Folks,
</p>

<p>
Here is my scenario,
</p>

<p>
 We  have a version control repository running on my end and we have the branch offices too.Now people are checking in and out tunneling through firewall to the version control server in my end.
</p>

<p>
Now my problem is remote users are experiencing slow process when they are doing version control transactions.
</p>

<p>
We thought of rsyncing  the repo to the remote machine.and the users can do the version control operations locally but how do we maintain the consistency of files in all offices ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks &amp; regards,
Britto

There's an interesting ongoing trend among hardware manufacturers, to
incorporate more and more low-end RAID functionality into either core 
motherboard circuitry or cheap add-on cards.  Unfortunately, the
resulting RAID functions tend to be slow and buggy compared to Linux
"md" driver software RAID.  Caveat emptor.

<p>
The 4723 appears to be genuine hardware RAID (albeit for RAID0 or RAID1
only), and is implemented as a port multiplier and RAID controller
add-on, that attaches to a SATA port, which is then for some reason
referred to as the "EZ-Backup" port, to which you can connect two SATA
drives.  Unfortunately, reports I hear suggest that it has very bad
performance.

My apologies for being a bit behind on maintenance of my SATA on Linux

Hey Ben.  Que pasa?  Apologies in advance, as I know this rambles quite
a bit.  I learned some important lessons from it, so thought I'd pass
them on.
</p>

<p>
I ran into a bit of (for me, anyway) an interesting mystery today, and
it partly concerns LG's very own Rick Moen.  I was reminded while
brousing through /current that I'd been meaning to go look into a few
things on Rick's Linux Mafia site (I'm presently in the last stages of
recovering from a failed hard drive[ii], and old bookmarks is about all
that's left to do).
</p>

<p>
So, Iceweasel --&gt; linuxmafia.net ...
</p>

<p>
Yup, that was my first mistake.  Rick's not at .net, he's at .com.  I
don't know how I came up with .net (creeping senility perhaps), but
there you are.  BTW, linuxmafia.net appears to be a P2P invite only
torrent site out of Georgia, as one of my mailinglist buddies was kind
enough to point out.  He followed that up with "whois is your friend."
</p>

<p>
Well, I knew that.  On the other hand, it's not always your (or my, at
least) friend because "whois -h whois.arin.net linuxmafia.com" shows
no match.  On the other hand, "dig mx" does work.  Um, wtf?  Is there
some serious Juju going on here, or am I just more ignorant than I
hope I am?
</p>

<p>
The plot thickens; I'm not the only one.  F-Secure appears to be a bit
confused on this sort of thing too.  see:
<pre>
   <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001203">http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001203</a>
</pre>
So, what's wrong with whois, or is there something magical going on
about Rick's (and F-Secure's example) sites?  Or, am I an idiot?
</p>

<p>
I was getting too cute with shell aliases[i], but I see plain old
"whois linuxmafia.com" does work quite nicely, showing it's registered
with Tucows Inc.  I thought my "arin" alias was all I needed to find
registry info in this part of the world, "ripe" for Europe, "apnic"
for the Far East, and etc.  Definitely not true.  Drat.
</p>

<p>
The moral of the story appears to be that (as a plain "whois $BLAH"
shows):
<pre>
    Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be 
    registered with many different competing registrars.
    Go to <a href="http://www.internic.net">http://www.internic.net</a> for detailed information.
</pre>
So, I ought to be giving up on my ("my friend") whois aliases.
</p>

<p>
--------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
On the off-chance you end up dumping this into LG's "Mailbag", I'll
add that anyone who hasn't spent time at Rick's site is missing
some great stuff.  I've learned a lot from him over the years, and his
wry, dry, diplomatic, and often truly vitriolic BOFH "we don't suffer
fools here!" style is damned entertaining.
</p>

<p>
And for Rick, guess what?  linuxone.com is still registered, at
Computer Services Langenbach Gmbh DBA joker.com.  DN squatter snapped
it up I guess, since it mentions none of the entities you mention in
your article.

Occasionally I get a window behaving in a way I haven't seen until recently. 
The window is not displayed, just the title bar. When I move the cursor over 
the title bar the rest of the window displays, but when the cursor is moved 
off the window it shrinks back to just the title bar. 
</p>

<p>
I assume that this is configurable behaviour in some way, but it seems to 
happen fairly randomly. It's most common in JBuilder (spit), but it's also 
happening to an xterm window at the moment.
</p>

<p>
The Window Manager is KDE and I'm running Debian Etch. Does anyone know what 
causes this and how to stop it?

[Forwarding Ben's private mail, with commentary, at his invitation.]
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, Centric CRM, Inc. has recently been one of the most
problematic of the ASP/Web firms abusing the term "open source" for
their products, in part because their flagship product (Centric CRM)
has been notorious during most of this past year as the <em>most</em> clearly
and unambiguously proprietary software to be offered with the ongoing
public claim of being "open source".
</p>

<p>
I'd call this (below-cited) PR campaign blitz -- apparently, they're
intensively hitting reporters known to be following this matter --
really good news, though it has to be read attentively:
</p>

<p>
o  Former OSI General Counsel Larry Rosen's "OSL 3.0" licence is a
   really good, excellently designed, genuine copyleft licence that is
   especially well suited for ASP use, because it's one of the very 
   few that have a clause enforcing copyleft concepts within the 
   otherwise problematic ASP market.  (In ASP deployments, there is
   ordinarily no <em>distribution</em> of the code, so the copyleft provisions
   of most copyleft licences such as GPLv2 have no traction, and are
   toothless.)  Also, as Centric CRM, Inc. is keen to point out, OSL
   3.0 is an OSI-certified open source licence.
</p>

<p>
o  At the same time, the careful observer will note that this 
   announcement concerns the product "Centric Team Elements v. 0.9",
   which is <em>not</em> (yet?) the firm's flagship product.  That flagship
   product remains the entirely separate -- and very, very clearly
   proprietary, product "Centric CRM v. 4.1", which one wryly notices
   has been carefully omitted completely from this communique.
</p>

<p>
   Just in case there is any doubt about Centric CRM 4.1's proprietary
   status, here's one key quotation from the product brochure, about
   the applicable licence, "Centric Public Licence (CRM)":  "The major 
   restriction is that users may not redistribute the the Centric CRM 
   source code."
</p>

<p>
Now, it may be that the Centric CRM product is on the way out, and that
Centric Team Elements (with genuine open source licence) will be taking
its place.  Or maybe not.  Either way:  
</p>

<p>
The bad news, but perhaps not too bad, is that Centric CRM, Inc. has
spent this past year to date falsely and misleadingly claiming that its
product line is open source -- and deflecting critics by claiming that
the term "open source" is (paraphrasing) subject to redefinition and
needn't be limited to what OSI (inventer of that term in the software
context, and standard body) defines it to be.  That misleading and
deceptive language is still very much a prominent part of the company's
pronouncements to this day, remains on the Web site, and doesn't seem to
be disappearing.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that the firm appears to be sensitive to the public
relations problem it created for itself, and <em>may</em> be taking steps to
fix it.
</p>

<h3>Sun Keyboard on a PC?</h3>

Hello all --
</p>

<p>
This question is purely to test the water.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  I remember a good few
years ago now using a Sun workstation running some old version of
SunOS.  One thing I remember about it clearly though is that it had a
<strong>cool</strong> keyboard with a whole set of keys down the far left-hand side
[1].
</p>

<p>
So I was wondering...
</p>

<p>
a)  Is this keyboard standard?  For instance, if I go looking for a
"sun keyboard", I'm not going to encounter several different versions
which work subtly different from one another, am I?
</p>

<p>
b) I've heard various rumours I'd need a sun &lt;--&gt; PC converter to use
such a keyboard?  Some websites say you need one, others don't even
mention it.  Some even say you build one, but I don't like the thought
of this -- I'm a software engineer for a reason; I hate hardware.
</p>

<p>
Using it under Linux (X11 specifically) wouldn't be much of a problem.
 I hope... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Hi all,
</p>

<p>
I am trying to install Xen 3.1.0 from source. When I do a "make world",
after some processing I get this
<pre>
Cannot find linux-2.6.18.tar.bz2 in path .
</pre>
and it starts retrieving the file from www.kernel.org
</p>

<p>
I do not want this. I have got a local copy of linux-2.6.18.tar.bz2 in
/usr/src as well as the directory where Xen source code is stored.
PATH setting did not help either.
</p>

<p>
How can I get around this?
</p>

<p>
I did install Xen 3.0 from synaptic,but it did not seem to work
either. It is not able to boot into the Xen kernel, because the file
vmlinuz-xen-0 is not created at all.
</p>

<p>
Please suggest how I can get Xen up and running!
</p>

<p>
Thanks

Hi all,
</p>

<p>
Keeping in mind the wide variety of domains, age-group and experience
of TAG, I would be really interested to get some project proposals,
specifications of which are mentioned below:
</p>

<p>
1. Duration - 6 Months
</p>

<p>
2. Domains related to : Network Security, Clusters, Embedded or Real Time  Systems.
</p>

<p>
This is a final year project for me. So I am really looking forward to
project work which is going to have some real-world value. Please note
that the topics i have given are of my interest and ideas are welcome
in other topics as well.
</p>


<p>
Cheers,
<pre>--

<p>
Folks:
</p>

<p>
 I need to do the following stuff:
</p>

<p>
 Find the particular string in a file and remove that line which has
that particular string from the file , that should be done from the
command line or from the script.
</p>

<p>
Thanx...
Britto
