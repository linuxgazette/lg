Hi all,
</p>

<p>
The latest issue (<a href="../139/index.html">http://linuxgazette.net/139/index.html</a>) of LG has a
new feature - a "Digg this!" button (as you must have noticed it). I
am looking after this sub-project. I would like to get some feedback
about this as to how to improve it; or any modifications /suggestions.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,

<p>
I have searched the net (google, newsgroups ...) to find an answer to
this question .- but without success.
</p>

<p>
In KDE (for example) you can get individual desktops backgrounds for
each virtual desktop.
Well - i am used to a utility for M$-Windows called Xdesk that also
can set the the desktops to have individual icons / folders.
</p>

<p>
I know that in the windows world they change a regkey that tells where
the desktop belongs for each switch so such a 'true virtual desktop'
</p>

<p>
I have also in M$-Windows created bathc-files to use with less
intelligence window-managers, theese batch-files separately update the
regkey to get my own way to create 'true virtual desktops'
</p>

<p>
Is there any program that i can get to have different desktops-folders
or is there any way  to trick either  kde / gnomw / idesk to have
different desktops?
</p>

<p>
I suppose it should go with renaming the main folders there they save
the desktop-information for each switch, so the desktop you are on
have specific icons and settings, and then force kde /gnome / idesk /
whatever to update.
</p>

<p>
And yes - i know that the folder layout differs for Kde / Gnome /
Idesk / Whatever - i am satisfied with a solution that fits one of
theese or maybe someother Desktop Manager (for example XFCE4)
</p>

<p>
sorry for the length of the letter - feel free to strip out whatever
you like to make it place in the list.

   MI/X for Macintosh
   A Professional, Free X Server.
</p>

<p>
   Mac computers run the TNT products <a href="http://www.microimages.com/index.htm">http://www.microimages.com/index.htm</a>
   through the unique MicroImages X Server (MI/X), which MicroImages supplies
   with every TNT product for Macintosh.
</p>

<p>
   MicroImages is also pleased to make this X Server freely available for
   Macintosh users who do not have any of the TNT products. You may want to
   use your Power Macs as X terminals in a network environment -- MI/X works
   fine as an X terminal emulator. You may also want to make your PC a true X
   Server and run multiple X clients from your desktop. MI/X works fine
   there, too -- after all, that's why MicroImages developed MI/X in the
   first place.
</p>

<p>
   If you can configure a telnet session, you know enough to use MI/X. Since
   MI/X for the Macintosh is made freely available, MicroImages cannot
   respond to individual user requests for technical support. However,
   MicroImages maintains MI/X as the X Server for its line of TNT
   professional products <a href="http://www.microimages.com/index.htm">http://www.microimages.com/index.htm</a>, so you will
   find MI/X a stable and robust performer.
</p>

<p>
   If you have any questions comments or suggestions regarding MI/X for
   Macintosh contact us at mix@microimages.com

   User Reviews
</p>

<p>
   A free X Window server for Power Macs. It's got all the requisite features
   - host allow/deny, background configurability, etc. - and comes with twm,
   although you can use any other window manager.
</p>

<p>
   "Although it was not as easy to configure as come commercial X server
   software, I was connecting to our UNIX server relatively effortlessly.
   It's a great tool to have in our computer lab to connect to the
   workstation for one of our research projects." - Jiro Fujita
</p>

<p>
   "This is an amazing piece of software - especially considering the price.
   MI/X performs well on my 7200/90 and is very much easier to set up and use
   than MacX or its reincarnation, Xoftware. I noted a few minor bugs with
   screen redrawing when using the backing store but on first impression this
   seems to be a useful and usable X-server." - David Robertson, Programmer,
   Department of Computer Science, University of Otago

<p>
Folks,
</p>

<p>
Here is my scenario,
</p>

<p>
 We  have a version control repository running on my end and we have the branch offices too.Now people are checking in and out tunneling through firewall to the version control server in my end.
</p>

<p>
Now my problem is remote users are experiencing slow process when they are doing version control transactions.
</p>

<p>
We thought of rsyncing  the repo to the remote machine.and the users can do the version control operations locally but how do we maintain the consistency of files in all offices ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks &amp; regards,
Britto

There's an interesting ongoing trend among hardware manufacturers, to
incorporate more and more low-end RAID functionality into either core 
motherboard circuitry or cheap add-on cards.  Unfortunately, the
resulting RAID functions tend to be slow and buggy compared to Linux
"md" driver software RAID.  Caveat emptor.

<p>
The 4723 appears to be genuine hardware RAID (albeit for RAID0 or RAID1
only), and is implemented as a port multiplier and RAID controller
add-on, that attaches to a SATA port, which is then for some reason
referred to as the "EZ-Backup" port, to which you can connect two SATA
drives.  Unfortunately, reports I hear suggest that it has very bad
performance.

My apologies for being a bit behind on maintenance of my SATA on Linux

Hey Ben.  Que pasa?  Apologies in advance, as I know this rambles quite
a bit.  I learned some important lessons from it, so thought I'd pass
them on.
</p>

<p>
I ran into a bit of (for me, anyway) an interesting mystery today, and
it partly concerns LG's very own Rick Moen.  I was reminded while
brousing through /current that I'd been meaning to go look into a few
things on Rick's Linux Mafia site (I'm presently in the last stages of
recovering from a failed hard drive[ii], and old bookmarks is about all
that's left to do).
</p>

<p>
So, Iceweasel --&gt; linuxmafia.net ...
</p>

<p>
Yup, that was my first mistake.  Rick's not at .net, he's at .com.  I
don't know how I came up with .net (creeping senility perhaps), but
there you are.  BTW, linuxmafia.net appears to be a P2P invite only
torrent site out of Georgia, as one of my mailinglist buddies was kind
enough to point out.  He followed that up with "whois is your friend."
</p>

<p>
Well, I knew that.  On the other hand, it's not always your (or my, at
least) friend because "whois -h whois.arin.net linuxmafia.com" shows
no match.  On the other hand, "dig mx" does work.  Um, wtf?  Is there
some serious Juju going on here, or am I just more ignorant than I
hope I am?
</p>

<p>
The plot thickens; I'm not the only one.  F-Secure appears to be a bit
confused on this sort of thing too.  see:
<pre>
   <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001203">http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001203</a>
</pre>
So, what's wrong with whois, or is there something magical going on
about Rick's (and F-Secure's example) sites?  Or, am I an idiot?
</p>

<p>
I was getting too cute with shell aliases[i], but I see plain old
"whois linuxmafia.com" does work quite nicely, showing it's registered
with Tucows Inc.  I thought my "arin" alias was all I needed to find
registry info in this part of the world, "ripe" for Europe, "apnic"
for the Far East, and etc.  Definitely not true.  Drat.
</p>

<p>
The moral of the story appears to be that (as a plain "whois $BLAH"
shows):
<pre>
    Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be 
    registered with many different competing registrars.
    Go to <a href="http://www.internic.net">http://www.internic.net</a> for detailed information.
</pre>
So, I ought to be giving up on my ("my friend") whois aliases.
</p>

<p>
--------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
On the off-chance you end up dumping this into LG's "Mailbag", I'll
add that anyone who hasn't spent time at Rick's site is missing
some great stuff.  I've learned a lot from him over the years, and his
wry, dry, diplomatic, and often truly vitriolic BOFH "we don't suffer
fools here!" style is damned entertaining.
</p>

<p>
And for Rick, guess what?  linuxone.com is still registered, at
Computer Services Langenbach Gmbh DBA joker.com.  DN squatter snapped
it up I guess, since it mentions none of the entities you mention in
your article.

Occasionally I get a window behaving in a way I haven't seen until recently. 
The window is not displayed, just the title bar. When I move the cursor over 
the title bar the rest of the window displays, but when the cursor is moved 
off the window it shrinks back to just the title bar. 
</p>

<p>
I assume that this is configurable behaviour in some way, but it seems to 
happen fairly randomly. It's most common in JBuilder (spit), but it's also 
happening to an xterm window at the moment.
</p>

<p>
The Window Manager is KDE and I'm running Debian Etch. Does anyone know what 
causes this and how to stop it?

[Forwarding Ben's private mail, with commentary, at his invitation.]
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, Centric CRM, Inc. has recently been one of the most
problematic of the ASP/Web firms abusing the term "open source" for
their products, in part because their flagship product (Centric CRM)
has been notorious during most of this past year as the <em>most</em> clearly
and unambiguously proprietary software to be offered with the ongoing
public claim of being "open source".
</p>

<p>
I'd call this (below-cited) PR campaign blitz -- apparently, they're
intensively hitting reporters known to be following this matter --
really good news, though it has to be read attentively:
</p>

<p>
o  Former OSI General Counsel Larry Rosen's "OSL 3.0" licence is a
   really good, excellently designed, genuine copyleft licence that is
   especially well suited for ASP use, because it's one of the very 
   few that have a clause enforcing copyleft concepts within the 
   otherwise problematic ASP market.  (In ASP deployments, there is
   ordinarily no <em>distribution</em> of the code, so the copyleft provisions
   of most copyleft licences such as GPLv2 have no traction, and are
   toothless.)  Also, as Centric CRM, Inc. is keen to point out, OSL
   3.0 is an OSI-certified open source licence.
</p>

<p>
o  At the same time, the careful observer will note that this 
   announcement concerns the product "Centric Team Elements v. 0.9",
   which is <em>not</em> (yet?) the firm's flagship product.  That flagship
   product remains the entirely separate -- and very, very clearly
   proprietary, product "Centric CRM v. 4.1", which one wryly notices
   has been carefully omitted completely from this communique.
</p>

<p>
   Just in case there is any doubt about Centric CRM 4.1's proprietary
   status, here's one key quotation from the product brochure, about
   the applicable licence, "Centric Public Licence (CRM)":  "The major 
   restriction is that users may not redistribute the the Centric CRM 
   source code."
</p>

<p>
Now, it may be that the Centric CRM product is on the way out, and that
Centric Team Elements (with genuine open source licence) will be taking
its place.  Or maybe not.  Either way:  
</p>

<p>
The bad news, but perhaps not too bad, is that Centric CRM, Inc. has
spent this past year to date falsely and misleadingly claiming that its
product line is open source -- and deflecting critics by claiming that
the term "open source" is (paraphrasing) subject to redefinition and
needn't be limited to what OSI (inventer of that term in the software
context, and standard body) defines it to be.  That misleading and
deceptive language is still very much a prominent part of the company's
pronouncements to this day, remains on the Web site, and doesn't seem to
be disappearing.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that the firm appears to be sensitive to the public
relations problem it created for itself, and <em>may</em> be taking steps to
fix it.

<h3>Sun Keyboard on a PC?</h3>

<p>
Hello all --
</p>

<p>
This question is purely to test the water.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  I remember a good few
years ago now using a Sun workstation running some old version of
SunOS.  One thing I remember about it clearly though is that it had a
<strong>cool</strong> keyboard with a whole set of keys down the far left-hand side
[1].
</p>

<p>
So I was wondering...
</p>

<p>
a)  Is this keyboard standard?  For instance, if I go looking for a
"sun keyboard", I'm not going to encounter several different versions
which work subtly different from one another, am I?
</p>

<p>
b) I've heard various rumours I'd need a sun &lt;--&gt; PC converter to use
such a keyboard?  Some websites say you need one, others don't even
mention it.  Some even say you build one, but I don't like the thought
of this -- I'm a software engineer for a reason; I hate hardware.
</p>

<p>
Using it under Linux (X11 specifically) wouldn't be much of a problem.
 I hope... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Hi all,
</p>

<p>
I am trying to install Xen 3.1.0 from source. When I do a "make world",
after some processing I get this
<pre>
Cannot find linux-2.6.18.tar.bz2 in path .
</pre>
and it starts retrieving the file from www.kernel.org
</p>

<p>
I do not want this. I have got a local copy of linux-2.6.18.tar.bz2 in
/usr/src as well as the directory where Xen source code is stored.
PATH setting did not help either.
</p>

<p>
How can I get around this?
</p>

<p>
I did install Xen 3.0 from synaptic,but it did not seem to work
either. It is not able to boot into the Xen kernel, because the file
vmlinuz-xen-0 is not created at all.
</p>

<p>
Please suggest how I can get Xen up and running!
</p>

<p>
Thanks

Hi all,
</p>

<p>
Keeping in mind the wide variety of domains, age-group and experience
of TAG, I would be really interested to get some project proposals,
specifications of which are mentioned below:
</p>

<p>
1. Duration - 6 Months
</p>

<p>
2. Domains related to : Network Security, Clusters, Embedded or Real Time  Systems.
</p>

<p>
This is a final year project for me. So I am really looking forward to
project work which is going to have some real-world value. Please note
that the topics i have given are of my interest and ideas are welcome
in other topics as well.
</p>

<p>
Sorry I do not have the last mail in this series.  Please post this mail 
properly to TAG list members and wherever else it goes.  I discovered our 
long email exchange is now on the web.  Thanks.
</p>

<p>
The author of BasicLinux helped me to get eznet working properly for 
'user'.  He said eznet behaves properly (does not reset permissions on 
/dev/tty*) if you exit it (ppp-off) before rebooting.  Otherwise it
leaves permissions reset so only root can dial.  (It might be safest to 
also chmod o+w /dev/ttyS1 in rc too for when user forgets to hang up).
</p>

<p>
I am finally ready to set up the latest version of Basiclinux (3.50 - with 
jwm window manager that can be used without a mouse) for use by 'user'.
</p>

<p>
61MB with libc5 (used in the original download to save space), glibc 2.2.5 
so (added for Opera), links, links2, lynx, Opera 9.21, kermit, msmtp (SMTP 
authentication), base64 to encode attachments for msmtp, dropbear and scp, 
abiword, netpbm, gs-8.54, mplayer, sox, svgalib, svp (svgalib-based ps/pdf 
viewer), zgv, antiword, xlhtml, ppthtml, all added to the jwm menu, and 
everything that came in the original 2-FD download including Xvesa, jwm, 
mgp, xli, and pcmcia support but no compiler.  2.2.26 kernel so no 
USB-storage support unless you change to 2.4.31 kernel and modules.
</p>

<p>
To start vt1 in X:
tty1::respawn:-/bin/sh -sc startx
rather than changing runlevels.
</p>

<p>
What else might the novice linux user want?  Someone's friend says their 
computer is too slow for the internet.  I will make it run faster by 
adding linux.
</p>

<p>
Running Linux 2nd Edition (kernel 1.1) recommended 40MB for linux, or 
250MB for a really large distribution.  I could have done it in about 30MB 
by leaving out Opera and Abiword, which did not exist then.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to everyone on the TAG list for all the help and education.

&gt; Hey guys:
&gt; 
&gt; I currently have a Toshiba Prot√©g√© M200 and I would love to play
&gt; around with a Linux LiveCD distro.  This machine does not have an
&gt; internal floppy and or CD/DVD drive, however, it does have the
&gt; capability to boot off the internal SD slot by copying a floppy-disk
&gt; image (up to 2.88MB) to the SD card as long as you name it
&gt; $tosfd00.vfd.
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you are thinking, but it'll never work...  Think of it
&gt; this way, you can have a 2GB SD card but only 1.44 or 2.88MB worth of
&gt; that 2GB is usable, the rest of the space cannot be read under Linux.
&gt; To enable the ability to read the remaining space of the SD card, a
&gt; driver must be present for the Toshiba SD card reader under Linux.
&gt; The reason it'll never work is because Toshiba won't release
&gt; information regarding the device, therefore no driver.
&gt; 
&gt; This brings me back to my original problem of getting a LiveCD to run
&gt; on my M200.  I just happened to stumbled upon Ben Okopnik "Booting Knoppix
&gt; from a USB Pendrive via Floppy" article and I thought to myself "that
&gt; might be exactly what need."  I read his entire article, but I am
&gt; still confused and don't know where to start.
&gt; 
&gt; I saw the downloadable file version of the script, but what do I do
&gt; with it. Keep in mind I don't have a Linux machine or any prior Linux
&gt; experience.
</pre>

<p>
Hi, Jermaine -
</p>

<p>
Well, that last bit is somewhat problematic - unless you can beg,
borrow, or steal a Linux machine for a while, or have a friend with one
who would be interested in helping you. Or, if you have access to a
desktop machine (i.e., something which isn't going to give you the kind
of problems that your Toshiba does), you could always boot Knoppix or
some other distro on it and get yourself all set up.
</p>

<p>
The procedure itself, once you've taken care of the above, is fairly
simple:
</p>

<p>
1) Download a Knoppix image [1] to your machine.
2) Download and run the script in the article; follow the prompts.
3) Copy the newly-created image to your flash device, as the last prompt
	says; however, in your case, try 
</p>

<pre>
dd if=boot.img of=/dev/sdb1/\$tosfd00.vfd
</pre>
instead of the suggested location (this assumes that your flash drive is
mounted as /dev/sdb, which is the common case.)
</p>

<p>
If the above doesn't work, feel free to ping TAG again - hopefully, with
a list of all errors that you've seen (pasted and copied, please - no
retyping!) and describing any non-text errors (i.e., "activity light on
drive didn't come on" or whatever.)
</p>

<p>
I suspect that it should work out OK for you, since the problem these
days is that the boot image is too big for the average floppy. However,
since you have a 2.88MB allowance, this is likely to not be a problem...
</p>

<p>
Let us know how it works out for you!
</p>

Hi, Emil!
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I'm way behind on reading LG, so I saw your question from April only 
&gt; today:
&gt; 
&gt;   <a href="../138/misc/lg/multipage_tif_file.html">http://linuxgazette.net/138/misc/lg/multipage_tif_file.html</a>
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It reminded me of a scanning/archiving assignment I got long time ago.  
&gt; I don't remember when but I mailed LG about it before.
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to merge to separate TIFF pages (extracted from a 30+ page 
&gt; scans using tiffsplit) into one PDF.  It went like this:
</pre>

<p>
tiffsplit?
</p>

<p>
Well, I just went off to install libtiff-tools, and tested tiffsplit on
the file I'd been trying to open back then. No go, still.
</p>

<pre>
TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, 552.tif: unknown field with tag 292 (0x124) encountered.
552.tif: Warning, incorrect count for field "DateTime" (19, expecting 20); tag ignored.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre>
Looks like the original file was, as I thought at the time,
exquisitely..."modified" to be "functional" in Wind0ws and borken
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Ah well, thanks to that problem, I've acquired a suite of tiff tools.
(Thank you for the nudge to add libtiff-tools to the arsenal.)
</p>



<pre>
&gt;  tiffcp xaa.tif xab.tif combined.tiff
&gt;  tiff2ps -2 -a combined.tiff | ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 - &gt; combined.pdf
&gt; 
&gt; You'll get a high quality PDF that is much smaller than the TIFFs.
</pre>

<p>
Nifty. It's pretty much the inverse (converse? reverse? obverse?) of the
problem I was having, but it's nice to have the tip handy. Thanks!

<h3>News in General</h3>


<h4>First Linux Collaboration Summit Held at Google</h4>

<p>Linux superstars, corporate heavyweights, and major customers all
converged on the Mountain View Googleplex for the first of many
Collaboration Summits. Hosted by the new Linux Foundation, the 3-day
event focused on developer issues and, as Linux Foundation CEO Jim
Zemlin stated, the sausage-making aspects of the open source
ecosystem.</p>

<p>Although it started just after the announcement of Linspire
partnering with Microsoft on multimedia support and patent IP (see
below), conference organizers steered away from discussing the new
Microsoft partnerships and potentially polarizing headlines. Instead,
the focus was on working together on common goals. "They're projecting
fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Let's come up with the things to move this
platform ahead," Zemlin told attendees on the first day, which was open
to journalists. After a public day with keynotes and press statements,
the Collaboration Summit continued behind closed doors, and with blog
silence.</p>

<p>The Linux Foundation hosted the Summit to bring together the diverse
elements of the Linux community, and encourage face-to-face dialog.
Among the aims behind the creation of the Linux Foundation was to foster
innovation and act as a catalyst in the development of the open source
software ecosystem. To some extent, the rapid acceptance of Linux and
the diversity of projects has greatly enlarged what used to be a tight
group of people, and better means of coordination and problem solving
needs to be encouraged</p>

<p>Here's a link to the completed Summit schedule:<br>
<a href="https://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Agenda_and_Schedule">https://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Agenda_and_Schedule</a>
</p>

<p>The conference wiki is still bare, but here are a few of the Summit
highlights:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>Marc Shuttleworth (of Canonical and Ubuntu fame) praised the
collaborative nature of the open source community and the tools
developed to help coordinate work on OS projects, but said more work
needed to be done to foster sharing and collaboration between existing
projects and their respective communities.</p>

<p>"Collaboration is an easy term to say, but it's hard to do. We often
don't know whom to talk to, upstream, so the question is: how can we make
collaboration better?", Shuttleworth asked.</p>

<p>Later in his keynote, he emphasized the importance of getting timely
patches out to Linux users. He also cautioned against viewing the
differences between the open source community and the Microsoft world as
a new Cold War. He said it was more about the underlying ideas than
about the personalities and companies. [What was the term from the
1960s? "Peaceful Co-existence"?]</p>

<li>
<p>Some discussion continued on the third version of the GPL. The
attending kernel developers were reported to be polite but unswerving in
their desire to continue with GPL v2. The consensus seemed to be to
wait, and see how adoption of GPL v3 goes in the application space,
first.</p>

<li>
<p>Brian Aker, Director of Architecture at MySQL, led a discussion
on issues with implementation of Linux threads that had users reverting
to earlier kernel versions (or even switching to versions of Solaris).
This also touched on issues with variation between distros.</p>

<li>
<p>Efforts were also coordinated for better device drivers,
especially printer drivers. LF announced a new LSB driver development
kit at the Summit. According Zemlin, "The LSB print driver development
kit is exactly the kind of work we can expedite as a united community of
developers, vendors, and users. We all know we have to make it extremely
easy for printing manufacturers to target Linux.  This kit will reduce
the effort it takes for them to take advantage of the tremendous
opportunity Linux represents, and will help users 'just print' while
using the Linux desktop and printer of their choice."</p>

<li>
<p>There was also recognition that, with the open-sourcing of
many development tools, toolmakers are reluctant to invest in
frameworks and integration tools that match the utility and
sophistication of Microsoft's Visual Studio suite. Eclipse goes part of
the distance, but has to accommodate multiple developer needs and
overlapping development models. Developers and ISVs have too many
choices and too few standards.</p>
</ul>


<p>Here is a small PDF showing Google's wish list of development
enhancements:<br>

<h4>Canonical Provides Details for Ubuntu for Mobile Internet Devices</h4>

<p>Canonical Ltd., the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu, announced more
details on Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded Edition, at Computex 2007 in
Taipei. Following discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Seville,
Spain, and a great response from its developer community generally, the
target specifications and technical milestones for the project have been
agreed. (With recent patches that support real-time processing in the
kernel, some 50-60% of new mobile phones will be based on embedded
Linux.)</p> 

<p>Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded Edition will provide a rich Internet
experience for users of Intel's 2008 Mobile Internet Device (MID)
platform. To achieve this, Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded will run video,
support sound, and offer fast and rich browsing experiences to the MID
target user. Optimized for MIDs based on Intel's low power processors
and chipsets, Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded edition is expected to deliver
fast boot and resume times, and reside in a small memory and disk
footprint.</p>

<p>"We are delighted with the progress of the Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded
Edition", commented Jane Silber, Director of Operations at Canonical. "We
have had a great response to our first announcement, with many developers
showing interest in the project. With a clear roadmap, an active
developer community, and a date for release, we look forward to bringing
Ubuntu to Mobile Internet Devices."</p>

<p>The first full release of the software will be available in October
2007. Working collaboratively with Intel, Canonical is working to
deliver software on actual devices in 2008.</p>

<p>(While this is, independently, good for Ubuntu and many mobile
developers, large companies and ISPs continue to be concerned about the
large number of Linux mobility platforms and lack of overarching
standards. This is being noted increasingly at analyst events, and by
companies such as Gartner and the 451 Group.)</p>


<h4>Massive Multi-Web Site Attack Sweeps Europe, Enters US</h4>

<p>Over 10,000 Web sites have been compromised by the "Mpack" hacker
kit, and upwards of 100,000 user systems have had malware installed. The
majority of compromised Web sites are in Italy, but the US has the third
highest number of infected Web sites.</p>

<p>The multiexploit "Mpack" is a Russian collection of PHP script
exploits that also collects statistics on the individual exploits.
The hacked sites usually have additional IFRAME code embedded within the
HTML source code, referencing the exploit server. Users are redirected to
Web pages that download keyloggers, and other malware and exploits are
selected based on the user's OS and browser.</p>

<p>Details on Mpack and its management console are reported at the
Websense and Symantec Web sites:<br>

<h4>JavaOne: OpenJDK.org Formed for Future Java Implementations</h4>

<p>Fulfilling its promise to the world last year, Sun is releasing a
fully buildable implementation of the JDK to the new OpenJDK community.
In front of a cheering developer audience at May's JavaOne, Sun's CEO
Jonathon Schwartz announced the OpenJDK project, which will be tasked
with implementing future releases of Java.</p>

<p>The project was seeded with Sun's May 6th JDK source bundle, which
includes 25,169 source files. Almost all of the JDK - 6.5 million lines
of code - is now available under the GPL, making it one of the largest
contributions to the free software community in history. Of these, 4% or
894 cannot be shipped in source form: there are no rights for Sun to
release the files, currently. An additional 1,885 files (8%) are not
under GPLv2: These are mostly Apache-derived code, according to Sun.</p>

<p>Most of this exception code includes font and graphics rasterizers,
sound engine code, and some crypto algorithms. There is also a little
SNMP code, and some code for the Imaging APIs. (Richard Stallman of the
Free Software Foundation has subsequently written that FOSSw developers
should focus on this small subset of the JDK, and set Java completely
free.) The encumbered code for the current JDK resides in the
ALT_CLOSED_JDK, mostly in binaries. These are fully redistributable.</p>

<p>To help develop the community around OpenJDK, Sun launched a
developer Web site: <a
href="http://openjdk.java.net/">http://openjdk.java.net/</a></p>

<p>The site allows developers to download a full source-code bundle, or
use Subversion to check out the code from the repository. Developers can
contribute a patch to fix a bug, enhance an existing component, or
define a new feature. Beside on-going blogs, the site also has links to
live conversation via IRC on irc.oftc.net (#openjdk).</p>

<p>On the OpenJDK Web site, the founding engineers write: "With the
community's help, we hope that encumbered code can be re-implemented
over the next 6 to 12 months, balancing this critical engineering task
with other priorities, and depending on the level of community
participation in speeding this effort."</p>

<p>See FAQ at <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/java/faq.jsp">http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/java/faq.jsp</a>.</p>

<p>Also: Sun announced a one-year roadmap for the OpenJDK initiative,
including clearing the remaining encumbrances, open-sourcing an
implementation of Java SE 6 and associated deployment code,
implementation of the compatibility testing and branding program, and
establishment of the governance and contribution model for the
community. At JavaOne, Sun announced the formation of the OpenJDK
Interim Governance Board, with the charter to write and gain ratification
for a constitution for the OpenJDK Community, based on transparency and
an open, meritocratic process. Initially, this is viewed as separate
from the Java Community Process (JCP), where specifications are thrashed
out, mostly with vendor input.</p>

<p>As part of the NetBeans 6 preview release, Sun has created pre-built
Netbeans projects to make it easy and intuitive to dive into the OpenJDK
code base. </p>


<h4>MS rattles its patent sabers</h4>
<p>[with major contributions from LG copy editor Rick Moen]</p>

<p>Microsoft ignited a firestorm of controversy in the open source
community, when its lawyers used the medium of a <em>Fortune</em>
magazine article to specify an exact number of (alleged) MS patent
infringements in Linux and other FOSSw. The count was 235, including 42
violations for the kernel.</p>

<blockquote>"Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith and licensing chief
Horacio Gutierrez sat down with <em>Fortune</em> recently to map out
their strategy for getting FOSSw users to pay royalties."</blockquote>

<p>It may be that Microsoft is creating FUD to slow the increasing speed
of adoption of FOSSw at major corporations and many governments
worldwide -- all current and former MS clients. It may be that MS sees
the recent Supreme Court decision on software patents as weakening the
value of its own patent portfolio, and thus needs to act quickly to
maximize its advantage. Either way, the patent showdown will probably
get worse, over the next few months. Microsoft expects royalties or
cross-licensing deals, and maybe renewed customer loyalty.  That seems
to be the bottom line.</p>

<p>Microsoft has been asserting its patents recently, and has received
royalty payments from Novell and other companies like Samsung. To
prevent this trend, on March 28, the Free Software Foundation made
public a revised GPLv3 draft. That may have set the stage for a
confrontation with Microsoft, and perhaps between Microsoft and
companies championing open source, like IBM and Sun.</p>

<p>For an alternative take, several Groklaw commentators have pointed
out that:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>Microsoft may have torpedoed their own case in advance by shipping
a vast number of the usual GPLed and other open source codebases as part
of Microsoft Services for Unix (nee Interix), creating a defence of
equitable estoppel.</p>

<li>
<p>They will also face the defence of "laches" (impermissible delay),
which becomes a bigger bar to litigation with each day that passes since
<em>both</em> the <em>Fortune</em> magazine piece and their shipment of
Interix.</p>

<li>
<p>If Microsoft ever sues anyone for patent infringement concerning a
GPLed codebase, then both Microsoft (i.e., Interix) and patent-licensee
Novell will immediately lose the right to distribute that codebase, per
GPLv2 clause 7.</p>

</ol>


<p>Complicating the already volatile situation, Dell became the
first major systems provider to join the business collaboration that was
formed by Microsoft and Novell for intellectual property (IP) assurance.
As part of the agreement, Dell will purchase SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server certificates from Microsoft, and establish a services and
marketing program to migrate existing Linux users who are not Dell Linux
customers to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Under this extended
agreement, Dell will establish a customer marketing team for migrating
Linux users who are not Dell Linux customers to SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server.</p>

<p>"We're focused on delivering solutions that help simplify customers
IT operations," said Rick Becker, vice-president of solutions at Dell
Product Group. "Our customers have told us they want interoperability,
and expect technology vendors to work better together. Dell is the first
major systems provider to align with Microsoft and Novell in this
collaboration, and we intend to lead in this space. This move is a huge
success for the industry and, more specifically, for customers who
haven't purchased Linux through Dell and who want to migrate to SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server for the IP assurance and interoperability
benefits."</p>


<p>From our editor Rick Moen, commenting via the Linux Users of
Victoria mailing list:</p>

<p>"The <em>Fortune</em> piece that set off the patent debate contains
embarrassing factual gaffes such as this one:</p>

<blockquote>Lawyers for the Free Software Foundation have been able to
force developers who incorporated free software into proprietary
products to open up their source code, for instance."</blockquote>

<p>"This is a notorious bit of misinformation often promoted by various
opponents of copyleft licensing: In fact, copyright law provides no
mechanism whatsoever to compel such a disclosure, and no such event has
ever occurred (nor could it)."</p>

<p>Rick separately adds:</p>

<p>"You are advised to not hold your breath waiting for Microsoft
Corp. to state patent numbers and clarify what specific open source /
free-software codebases it believes are encumbered by its patents. For
one thing, that would -- as you suggest -- enable anyone and everyone to
assess those claims' merits.  Also, it would assist open-source coders
in, where necessary, rewriting their code with (probably) breathtaking
speed to use other, equivalent techniques. The Redmondians know -- from
watching the dismal fate of the few SCO infringement claims that SCO
bothered to detail usefully -- that they cannot compete in a fair match
of programming or analytical skill, so they instead make only vague
claims that their better-staffed and more-energetic competition cannot
address."</p>

<p>From Matt Asay, GM of Alfresco, who will be presenting at the
Open Source Business Conference in late May: "If we could have
referenced the MS 'patent threat' earlier [for our conference], it would
have doubled our attendance, I'm sure."</p>

<h4>OpenSUSE 10.3 Alpha four now out</h4>

<p>The openSUSE community announced the fourth public alpha release of
openSUSE 10.3. Highlights include the YaST meta packages handler;
InstLux allows users to start the Linux installation from Windows; TeX
Live replaces teTeX; first parts of KDE4svn entered Factory;
OpenOffice.org 2.2; GNOME 2.18.1; improvements to the init script
starter ('startpar') to reduce boot time; first changes to support Sony

<p>Quick link to the DVD torrent files:<br>
<a
href="http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/10.3-Alpha4/iso/torrent/openSUSE-10.3-Alpha4-DVD-i386.torrent">openSUSE-10.3-Alpha4-DVD-i386.iso</a> </p>


<h4>Kernel 2.6.22 release candidate 5 available</h4>

<p>Mid-June also saw the release of kernel 2.6.22-rc5. Said Linus: "On a
more serious note, I have to admit that I'm a bit unhappy with the pure
<em>volume</em> of changes this late in the game.  I was really wanting to stop
some of the merges, but, while not all of it really fixed regressions,
there really are a lot of bugfixes in there."</p> 


<h4>Fedora Core 7 is out</h4>

<p>Among the updates in Fedora 7 are user installation tools that allow
for several different "spins", which are variations of Fedora built from
a specific set of software packages. Each spin can be a combination of
software to meet requirements of specific end users. In addition to a
very small boot.iso image for network installation, users have the
following spin choices:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>GNOME and KDE desktop environment-based bootable Live images that
can be installed to a hard disk. These spins are meant for desktop users
who prefer a single disk installation, and for sharing Fedora with
friends, family, and event attendees.</p> 

<li>
<p>A regular image for desktops, workstations, and server users. This
spin provides a good upgrade path and similar environment for users of
previous releases of Fedora.</p>

<li>
<p>A set of DVD images that includes all software available in the Fedora 
repository.</p>

</ul>

<p>This release provides for enhanced wireless networking.  The
NetworkManager presents a graphical interface that allows user to
quickly switch between wireless and wired networks for increased
mobility. NetworkManager is installed by default in both GNOME and KDE
Live CDs.</p>

<p>Additionally, Fedora Core 7 uses Python 2.5, and all of the Python
software available in the repository uses it.<br>
<a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/whatsnew25.html">http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/whatsnew25.html</a>
</p>

<p>Fedora 7 includes Liberation fonts, which are metric equivalents for
several well-known proprietary fonts found throughout the Internet, and
give better results when viewing and printing shared documents.</p>


<h4>SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP1 now available</h4>

<p>SUSE 10 SP1 is out now, and provides enhancements in the areas from
the desktop to the data center, including:</p> 


<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhanced server virtualization and management enables unmodified Windows
and Linux guest operating systems to run with near native
performance.</p>

<li>
<p>Updated high availability storage infrastructure</p>

<li>
<p>Support for Open Enterprise Server 2 and paravirtualized NetWare.</p>

<li>
<p>Enhanced security features:</p>

   <ul>
   <li>
   <p>Novell AppArmor 2.0 security framework now includes support for
   Apache Tomcat.</p>
   </ul>

<li>
<p>Support for new processor technologies, including Quad-Core Intel Xeon
and AMD Opteron processors.</p>

</ul>

<p>On the desktop, SP1 delivers updates to the desktop effects engine, a
re-designed main menu, and the ability to play embedded video in
OpenOffice.org presentation files. It also provides improved integration
with enterprise technologies such as Microsoft Active Directory and
Microsoft Office, including the new OpenXML/ODF translator to convert
Microsoft Word 2007 documents to OpenOffice.org. (That Novell-Microsoft
patent deal, again!)</p>

<p><em>And</em>... SUSE Linux 9.3 is now officially discontinued, and out of
support.</p>

<h4>Skype for Linux 1.4 Beta</h4>

<p>Skype Version 1.4.0.74 for Linux was released June 14. "The big news
of this release is the support of glibc 2.3 systems. What this means is
that Skype 1.4 will now run on some older systems without upgrading the
base system."</p>

<p>Skype for Linux previously required glibc 2.3.3 or greater and Qt 3.2
or greater. If you do not have Qt 3.2 or greater, you are still able to
use Skype for Linux by downloading its static version that has Qt 3.2
compiled in.</p>

<p>Besides substantial bugfixes, this update 
includes Skype's own audio codec and an improved conference call 
mixer.<br> 
<a href="http://www.skype.com/download/skype/linux/">http://www.skype.com/download/skype/linux/</a></p>


<h4>Bugzilla 3.0</h4>

<p>As a present to its community, instead of releasing Bugzilla 2.24,
the Bugzilla Project has released Bugzilla 3.0. Earlier development
snapshots named 2.23.x have become the new Bugzilla 3.0. This is the
first major upgrade to the popular tool in almost a decade. Among the
Bugzilla changes are mod_perl support and a Web Services interface using
the XML-RPC protocol.

<h4>JavaOne and NASA's World Wind</h4>

<p>At the JavaOne conference in San Francisco, Robert Brewin, Sun's CTO
of software, and NASA's Patrick Hogan showed off a new open-source
geospatial browser plugin that implements Java GL and incorporates
NASA's visualization technology. The new software also allows developers
to create mashups and detailed geo-spatial simulations.</p>

<p>One demonstration was the DiSTI F-16 Flight Simulator, a Web plugin
based on Java GL Studio. It allowed a user to 'fly' an F-16 with
external and cockpit views, as it maneuvers over the Earth's terrain. A
collaboration between Sun Microsystems, NASA Ames, and DiSTI, the
simulator links Sun's Java Open GL platform, NASA's World Wind, which
provides actual satellite imagery and radar topography from Shuttle
missions, with GL Studio for Java - to enable Java developers to create
3D, real time visualizations of the Earth, using cost-effective, high
fidelity imagery. </p>

<p>DiSTI's GL Studio package lets an instructional designer integrate
photo-realistic objects into simulations that react just like the real
parts. Such parts affect the performance of the systems, and accurately
reproduce real behaviors (i.e., unscrew an important connector
from a simulated jet engine, and it will stop running.)</p>

<p>The NASA World Wind Java SDK is platform independent, and current
demos run under Fedora Core 6, Ubuntu, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS
X.</p>

<p>There were some problems with the World Wind download from NASA, but
these seem to have been fixed by mid-May. Check out the FAQ on WorldWind
Central: <a href="http://www.worldwindcentral.com/wiki/WWJava_FAQ">http://www.worldwindcentral.com/wiki/WWJava_FAQ</a></p>

<h4>Red Hat Adds Business Solutions to Open Source RHX</h4>

<p>In May, at Red Hat Summit 2007 in SAN DIEGO, Red Hat announced the
availability of Red Hat Exchange (RHX). RHX extends Red Hat's Open
Source Architecture to include integrated business application solutions
from fourteen open source partners<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> 
built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and JBoss platform software.</p>

<p>All solutions are purchased, delivered, and supported via a single,
standardized Red Hat subscription agreement with consolidated billing
covering the complete application stack. At the RHX Web site, customers
have access to application profiles, user ratings and reviews, free
trials, and online purchase options for all applications. Red Hat will
provide customers with a single point of contact for all support issues
throughout the application stack. In addition, RHX may be purchased
through select Red Hat Value-Added Reseller Channel partners.</p>

<p>RHX launch partners include Alfresco, CentricCRM, Compiere,
EnterpriseDB, Groundwork, Jaspersoft, Jive, MySQL, Pentaho, Scalix,
SugarCRM, Zenoss, Zimbra, and Zmanda.</p>

<p>"When customers can minimize the number of number of vendors they are
dealing with and the associated number of support contracts, they can
reduce the complexity and often the cost associated with managing
workloads," said Al Gillen, Research Vice President, System Software at
IDC.</p>

<p>For more information about RHX, visit <a

<h4>Red Hat Virtual Appliance OS to Manage Intel vPro-based
Desktops</h4>

<p>At its Red Hat Summit, Red Hat announced a joint program with Intel
to bring hardware-assisted virtualization to desktop PCs with Intel vPro
technology. Using Intel vPro PCs, IT departments will be able to deploy
appliances in a virtual machine that bring enterprise-class management
and security to the PC.</p>

<p>"The legacy desktop falls short in its ability to provide a secure,
reliable and manageable environment," said Brian Stevens, CTO at Red
Hat. "Intel vPro technology combined with a Red Hat Virtual Appliance OS
will allow customers to create a rock-solid foundation that can then
provision, manage and secure the PC. This technology will reduce
operational costs and increase operational flexibility."</p>

<p>The Appliance OS from Red Hat will support pluggable Virtual
Appliances to deliver functions such as network security, provisioning,
monitoring and asset management, regardless of the state of the desktop
OS. In collaboration with Intel, Red Hat plans to develop, productize,
and support software components, including the hypervisor, the Service
OS, and the Software Development Kit (SDK).</p>

<p>Active development on the project is underway today, with beta
software expected later this year and general release planned for 2008.
</p>


<h4>Linspire, Freespire Add Desktop Virtualization</h4>

<p>Linspire, Inc., developer of the Linspire commercial and Freespire
community desktop Linux operating systems, and Parallels, Inc., maker of
desktop virtualization solutions for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, have
announced the Parallels Workstation 2.2 desktop virtualization solution
for Linspire and Freespire users via CNR, a one-click delivery service
for desktop Linux software. The companies also announced a technology
partnership where Linspire will make a Freespire Virtual Appliance
available using Parallels.</p>

<p>"Virtualization continues to impact the industry," said Randy
Linnell, Vice-President of Business Development of Linspire. "We're
excited about expanding our relationship with one of the leaders."</p>

<p>Parallels Workstation for Linux is a virtualization solution allowing
Linux users to simultaneously run any version of Windows, including
Windows Vista, any Linux distribution, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, OS/2, eComStation, or DOS, in a stable, secure virtual machine
on any Linux-powered PC. No re-booting or partitioning is required, and
users never need to shut down or leave their home desktop to access a
virtual machine.</p>

<p>Parallels Workstation is available immediately to Linspire and
Freespire users for $49.99. Linspire and Freespire users can download
and buy Parallels Workstation via CNR at 
<a href="http://www.linspire.com/parallels">http://www.linspire.com/parallels</a>

<h3>Magical Realism</h3>


<h4>Lt. Cmdr. Data Added to CMU's Robot Hall of Fame</h4>

<p>Data, the inquisitive and evolving robot of Star Trek NG, was among
the four 2007 inductees announced for Carnegie Mellon University's Robot
Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>The four inductees - the one-legged Raibert Hopper, the NavLab 5
self-steering vehicle, the LEGO(R) Mindstorms kit, and Data - were
announced in May at the fourth annual RoboBusiness Conference in Boston.
Some robots from the first three induction classes include the Mars
Pathfinder Rover; Honda's ASIMO robot; the HAL 9000 computer from "2001:
A Space Odyssey"; the "Star Wars" duo of R2-D2 and C-3PO; and Gort, the
metallic giant from "The Day the Earth Stood Still." (Klaatu Barata
Nikto -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaatu_barada_nikto">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaatu_barada_nikto</a>)
</p>

<p>The one-legged Hopper was ideal for studying dynamic balance because
it could not stand still, but had to keep moving to stay upright. The
lessons learned with the Hopper proved central for biped, quadruped, and
even hexapod running. NavLab 5's crowning achievement was "No Hands
Across America," a 1995 cross-country tour on which it did 98 percent of
the driving.</p>

<p>CMU plans a formal induction ceremony for the four robots in the
fall. <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2007/May/may15_rhof.shtml">http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2007/May/may15_rhof.shtml</a></p>


<h4>Reinventing the Mag Stripe</h4>

<p>QSecure, Inc., a SV startup with multiple patents in credit card
authentication technology, has announced new technology that
significantly reduces fraud resulting from stolen card data. The
company's SmartStripe technology protects against counterfeit fraud
without requiring changes in retail systems or card holder behavior.</p>

<p>SmartStripe technology incorporates dynamic cryptography on the
card's magnetic stripe, augmenting the static data on the magnetic
stripe. Each time a consumer uses a SmartStripe card, a proprietary
magnetic media chip embedded in the magnetic stripe programs a unique
cryptographic number on the stripe that is valid for only one
transaction. If the payment card's data is compromised, and criminals
attempt to re-use the data from the stripe, card issuers will be able to
stop the transaction in real time.</p>

<p>Unlike other solutions which require changes to the existing credit
card infrastructure, QSecure's technology works seamlessly within the
existing retail system, requiring no modifications to merchants' card
readers. Further, its usage is transparent to the card holder, so no
changes to buying behavior are necessary. Future versions of QSecure
solutions will incorporate a small, flexible display to secure online
and other card-not-present transactions. The company is now working on
programs with major card issuers.</p>

<a name="1"></a>
<p> [1] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>: On account of
what I assume was a lapse in management concerning this program, an
oversight that has not yet been corrected, Red Hat, Inc. has regrettably
published false claims in press releases such as this one, and others on 
both <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhx/">http://www.redhat.com/rhx/</a>
and on various subpages of <a
href="http://rhx.redhat.com/">http://rhx.redhat.com/</a> -- that Red Hat
Exchange's offerings are open source.</p>

<p>In fact, some are open source, some are under doubtful "badgeware"
MPL + restrictions licences whose sponsoring firms carefully avoid
submitting them to Open Source Initative for scrutiny lest they be
definitively rejected as open source, and some -- Centric CRM v. 4.1 
and Jive Software's OpenFire being obvious examples -- are very clearly, 
past any possibility of doubt, absolutely proprietary.  (Sixty seconds' 
checking should show readers that the Centric CRM's licence doesn't permit
redistribution, and, to quote 
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1384">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1384</a>,
"OpenFire has a time-based license that unlocks the Enterprise features
in the application. An e-mail is sent to purchasing customers with a
license file.")</p>

<p>I am among several people who have attempted to call Red Hat, Inc.'s
attention to these false and misleading statements (starting with a
private comment to the company's CTO immediately following the RHEL5 /
RHX product launch in San Francisco on March 14).  Their response thus
far has been very disappointing: my best guess is that we're hearing
only reactive and poorly-thought-out damage control from the very same
Marketing Department and Professional Services people who created this
program, i.e., that the issue has not yet reached upper management, but
rather remains bogged down among sponsoring middle managers motivated
only to sweep controversy under the rug.</p>  

<p>The latter group's spin control, in response to criticism, is in the
FAQ section of the "<a
href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285">More about
RHX</a>" page:</p>

<blockquote>
Q: Are you only accepting open source ISVs into RHX?<br>
A: The initial set of participating ISVs all have an open source focus. We
realize that there is debate about which companies are truly open
source. To make it transparent to users, RHX includes information about
each ISV's license approach. Longer term, we may introduce proprietary
applications that are friendly with open source applications.
</blockquote>

<p>This is confused, largely nonsensical, and unresponsive to the issue:
The notion of an "open source company" is undefined and (more to the
point) irrelevant to the issue at hand.  By contrast, open-source
<strong>codebases</strong> are abundantly well defined, by OSI's formal
and precise <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">Open Source
Definition</a> that has always been the guiding criterion since OSI
invented the concept (and definition) in 1998.</p>

<p>I strongly hope that RH management takes this issue in hand soon and
corrects the many distortive claims of open source within RHX, that are
unsupported by the plain facts about many of the offerings.</p>

<p>(A separate page at the RHX site, <a
href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1310">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1310</a>,
makes absolutely all of the RHX offerings seem proprietary, even the
ones that are, in fact, true open source.  Fortunately, I guess, the
licence summary on that page is not very competently written, and is
substantively in error on most items listed.)</p>

<h1>A Router With Just One Ethernet Port</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>If you want to connect multiple computers to
a cable modem then you normally need a router
with at least two network ports.  One port talks
to the cable modem, and the other port(s) talk
to the rest of the network.  The connections are
multiplexed so that the cable modem sees only
one machine, and the router can also act as a
firewall.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's not feasible to obtain a
machine with two Ethernet ports.  This might be
the case for example if you are working on a
temporary and/or test setup and don't have the
time or the resources to order extra hardware.
My motivation for writing this article was Kapil
Hari Paranjape's article "Debian on a Slug" in
LG #138, in which he needed to use either two
separate networks (Ethernet and wi-fi) or a
network with an existing firewall/router in
order to set up the NSLU2 (the "slug"), and I
wanted to see if it's possible to do without
that extra hardware.  Especially if the slug is
going to <em>be</em> a router/firewall, it seems
a little excessive to require another one before
you can set it up.</p>

<p>In this article I present some notes on how I
constructed a router and firewall using just one
Ethernet port on a Linux machine.  It wasn't
stable enough for long-term use, but it was
adequate for temporary situations that call for
sharing a cable modem between two or three
machines.</p>

<h3>Why One Ethernet Port Can Be Enough</h3>

<p>A cable modem is basically a network bridge,
repeating selected packets from your network to
the provider's network and vice versa.  It is
usually a transparent learning bridge conforming
to the IEEE 802.1d standard; it "learns" a
number of your Ethernet addresses, and the ISP
usually limits this number to one.  If it sees
additional Ethernet addresses then it will
simply ignore them.  That is why you usually
need to switch the modem off and on again when
moving it from one machine to another.</p>

<p>If the modem is going to ignore any machine
except the first one it sees, then there is
nothing in principle to stop that first machine
from acting as a router for other machines
<em>even on the same Ethernet segment</em>.  For
example, consider the following setup:</p>

<pre class="code">
            4-port Unswitched Ethernet Hub
         port 1   port 2     port 3    port 4
           |        |          |         |
         Modem   Machine A  Machine B  Machine C
</pre>

<p>The hub simply repeats any traffic it
receives, because it's unswitched.  (In fact
it's possible to make do with some simple wire
connections; more on this later.)  Therefore,
the modem sees all traffic from all machines,
and conversely all machines see the traffic from
the modem.  However, the modem will refuse to
communicate with anything except the first
machine it sees.  Suppose that this is Machine
A.  If Machine B wants to send to the outside
world, it first sends to Machine A (and the
modem ignores this), then Machine A repeats it
(and the modem takes it).  Then the reply is
addressed by the modem to Machine A (which
Machine B will ignore unless its Ethernet
interface is set to promiscuous mode) and
Machine A can repeat it for Machine B.  Note
that no machine needs more than one ethernet
port.</p>

<p>This approach is inefficient because
everything has to be repeated twice on the same
wire.  Even though Ethernet is generally much
faster than broadband, the repetitions can still
reduce the speed because they always congest
every transmission.  In spite of this, the setup
can still run at a reasonable speed, especially
if your adapters are all 100Mbps or more.</p>

<h3>Using A Simple Unpowered Hub</h3>

<p>If you have a powered hub or switch then you
can skip to the next section.</p>

<p>Some cheap devices called "ethernet
splitters" are essentially passive hubs.  Care
should be taken though because sometimes other
things are also sold as "ethernet splitters",
such as devices to use the spare wires in an
Ethernet cable for another connection, and
that's <em>not</em> useful in this setting.  If
you do find (or even make) a simple unpowered
passive hub or "ethernet splitter", you have to
think about certain characteristics of Ethernet
that can make this more complex than using a
powered hub.</p>

<p>10-base-T wiring has different wires for
transmit and receive.  If several computers are
connected using a hub, then what <em>should</em>
happen is, if any computer sends data on its
"transmit" line, then this data will be placed
on the "receive" lines of all the other
computers (or perhaps not all of them if it is a
switched hub).</p>

<p>Some simple "ethernet splitters" merely
connect all the "transmit" lines together and
all the "receive" lines together, so none of the
machines can actually exchange data unless one
of them crosses its connection (receives on the
shared "transmit" line and transmits on the
shared "receive" line).  Cable modems do
normally cross their connections, so those
"ethernet splitters" are intended to allow all
the machines to communicate with the modem
although not with each other.  This is not very
useful in the one-port router setup.</p>

<p>It would be more useful if all machines could
communicate with <em>the router</em> rather than
with the modem.  This can be arranged by
connecting the router to the hub with a
cross-over cable (or cross-over adaptor), and
using normal straight-through cable everywhere
else.  That way the router's "transmit" is
connected to the "receive" of all the other
machines and vice versa.  It might be necessary
to use a second cross-over cable to connect the
modem to the hub, in order to cancel out the
modem's own crossing-over (or, equivalently,
everything <em>except</em> the router and the
modem), but most modern cable modems will
automatically adapt anyway; just make sure the
router is the first machine to boot up.</p>

<p>Further problems can be caused by the
polarity auto-detection that's done by Ethernet
devices with auto-MDIX ports, and unfortunately
there's no way to turn that off other than to
use old hardware that doesn't have such
auto-detection.  (Many Ethernet cards have
commands to turn off auto-negotiation of
<em>speed</em> and <em>duplex</em>, but not
<em>polarity</em>.)  There should be no problems
when connecting the first two devices to the hub
(i.e. the router and the modem), but when the
third device is added, if that third device has
an auto-MDIX port then it may or may not guess
the correct polarity depending on which device
it sees first (remember they are opposites).
You might have to repeatedly disconnect and
reconnect the new device until it sees the
router, and if that new device is an NSLU2 which
you are trying to connect to a desktop router
during the initial setup stage then you'll have
to reboot it on every attempt.</p>

<p>To save the hassle of repeated connections
(and possibly reboots) of the new device, you
could try the following: After connecting only
the router and the modem to the hub and
verifying that the router can reach the outside
world (i.e. the modem has learned its MAC
address), disconnect the modem from the hub (but
without powering it off) and connect only the
new device to the hub.  Wait until you can ping
the new device, and then reconnect the modem
(you may have to reconnect the modem more than
once before it will work).  This allows the
device to negotiate polarity in a less confusing
environment, while still allowing the modem to
see the router first.</p>

<p>You may <strong>have</strong> to follow this
proceduce if the router <em>itself</em> has an
auto-MDIX port and the new device does
<em>not</em>, because it's then possible that
the router and the modem will have negotiated a
polarity that won't work with the new device no
matter how many times it's re-connected, so the
only option is to disconnect the modem while the
router detects the polarity of the new device.</p>

<p>If the new device <em>does</em> have
auto-MDIX then in some cases it may help to make
sure that the network is as quiet as possible
when connecting it.  This is because return
traffic from the modem is likely to increase the
probability of the new device guessing the wrong
polarity.</p>

<p>Finally, you may experience problems with the
cables themselves.  If the hub has no power then
it can't amplify the signal, so if the cables
are somewhat too long, or if there are cables
that are connected at the hub but not connected
to anything at the other end (or the device they
are connected to is switched off), then this can
harm the signal too much and the network will
stop working, so try to use shorter cables and
don't put any cable on the hub until it's
active.  Also, beware of fiddly connectors: it
took me many hours to track down a fault that
was caused by one of the Ethernet plugs working
intermittently because I had damaged it while
connecting things.</p>

<h3>Linux Commands For One-port Routing</h3>

<p>Linux lets you run multiple IP addresses on
the same interface, using "aliases".  This is
useful if you want the router to appear with a
private 192.168 address for the local network,
but with whatever address it is assigned for the
ISP.  After the router has DHCP-negotiated with
the ISP using <tt>dhclient</tt> or equivalent,
you can do this:</p>

<pre>
ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.0.0
</pre>

<p>replacing eth0 with whatever other interface
you are using if necessary.  The :1 can also be
:2, :3 etc to add more IP addresses; you can
have up to 256 different IP addresses on the
same interface if you want.</p>

<p>Note: This article assumes that your upstream
DHCP server does <em>not</em> give you an IP
address that is within the 192.168 subnet.  If
it does (which may be the case if your outgoing
connection is shared privately) then you could
replace 192.168 with 172.16 throughout this
article, because 172.16 is also reserved for
private use.  You may have difficulty performing
initial set-up of an NSLU2 if you cannot control
192.168 however.</p>

<p>Once you have a local-network IP, you can
then you can switch on NAT connection
forwarding:</p>

<pre class="code">
modprobe iptable_nat
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre>

<p>It may also help to allow the local 192.168
network to access any services running on the
router, if its firewall does not already allow
this:</p>

<pre>
iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.1 -j ACCEPT
</pre>

<p>You may also wish to run a DHCP server for
the local network, to save having to manually
configure your other machines' IP addresses.
This usually means installing a package like
<tt>dhcp</tt> and putting something like the
following into <tt>/etc/dhcpd.conf</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
  range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.199;
  option routers 192.168.1.1;
  option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
}
</pre>

<p>and then run or restart <tt>dhcpd</tt>.  When
putting all this in the system startup scripts,
check that the above commands run before
<tt>dhcpd</tt> (in a default Debian installation
it suffices to put them at the end of the
<tt>start)</tt> section of
<tt>/etc/init.d/networking</tt>).</p>

<p>It may also help to ensure that
<tt>dhclient</tt> waits to be assigned an
address by an <em>outside</em> DHCP server,
<em>not</em> by the DHCP server running on the
same machine (which may respond first,
especially if the outside server goes down for a
while).  To do this, put</p>

<pre>
reject 192.168.1.1;
</pre>

<p>into <tt>dhclient.conf</tt> (usually in the
<tt>/etc/dhcp3</tt> directory).  This is not
necessary if you are setting up a one-off router
manually and do not need it to work at system
startup, because in that case the DHCP client
will likely have obtained an outside address
before you can type the commands.</p>

<p>Note that the above <tt>option
domain-name-servers</tt> in <tt>dhcpd.conf</tt>
will work only if the router is running a DNS
cache such as <tt>pdnsd</tt> (available as a
Debian package); if you don't want to run that
extra server then you'll have to arrange for the
upstream DNS server to be copied into
<tt>dhcpd.conf</tt>.</p>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The above commands are reasonably secure by
default.  While it is relatively easy for
someone on the outside Internet to send a packet
to your router with a fake 192.168 source IP,
they will not normally be able to set the
<em>destination</em> to anything other than your
router's public IP address, which means they
will not be able to access any private servers
that are open only on your router's 192.168
address (that's why the above <tt>INPUT</tt>
rule uses <tt>-d</tt> to specify the
<em>destination</em> IP address as being
192.168.1.1, rather than simply constraining the
source IP).  Also because of the natural
constraint on the destination IP, they will not
be able to access any of your computers other
than the router (even if you have a hub that
allows everything to see the modem traffic), nor
will they be able to get your router to help
forward their packets either to your network or
to elsewhere.</p>

<p>However, there are some circumstances in
which it <em>is</em> possible for an attacker to
deliver packets into your network with a
destination IP address other than that of your
public IP.  This can happen if the attacker
takes over your ISP's equipment, or if your
ISP's equipment allows source routing, or if the
attacker breaks into the connection
on <em>your</em> side of the ISP.  If you wish, you
can take extra steps to protect your private
network from this kind of attack.</p>

<p>Such steps involve both protecting the router
itself, and ensuring that it is not possible to
place packets on the network that bypass the
router.</p>

<p>The router itself can be protected by adding
MAC-address rules so that it accepts packets
only from the known MAC addresses of your
network adapters and does not accept
inappropriate packets from the modem.  See the
<tt>iptables(8)</tt> man page for details.  Note
that cable modems' MAC addresses have been known
to change at power-cycling, so it's better to
make a list of all your <em>other</em> MAC
addresses.  In order to get past this test, an
attacker would either have to get packets onto
your network by some means other than via the
cable modem, or else break into the modem itself
or (in some cases) the ISP's head node.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> get the other machines on
your network to also recognise unwanted packets
by MAC address, but you may have some machines
that cannot run firewalls, and if they can see
the traffic from the cable modem before it gets
to the router then you could have a problem if
an attacker can fake destination IP addresses.
The best workaround to this is probably to use a
simple "ethernet splitter" hub (see the above
section) which physically prevents traffic from
bypassing the router even though the router has
only one port.</p>

<h3>Routing Packets Between The Private Machines</h3>

<p>If the private network is such that all the
machines can see the router but they cannot see
each other, then, if you need them to be able to
communicate with each other, you need to arrange
for this to go through the router even though
they're on the same subnet.  This is not too
difficult if you can manipulate their route
tables by hand, but it's slightly more difficult
with DHCP (and note that most DHCP client
implementations don't support all the extra
options).  You could simply set up
port-forwarding rules on the router and have the
other machines explicitly connect to the router
rather than to each other (more on
port-forwarding below).  A more transparent
solution (but more complex to set up) is to
arrange for the router to listen on many
different IP addresses, each on a very small
subnet (with a very narrow network mask) and to
allow only one DHCP-allocable address on each
of these subnets.  At any rate, expect the
network speed to be less than what it would be
if you had a proper switch, because everything
is being repeated.</p>

<h3>Port Forwarding</h3>

<p>One final thing you may wish to do is to
forward ports, both to make allowances for
running public servers such as a Web server, and
to facilitate communication between the machines
on the private network if they can't see each
other (see previous section).</p>

<p>If the server is run on the router itself
then this is simply a matter of ensuring the
router's firewall allows incoming connections on
that port, if it does not already do so.  (When
specifying that the server is for the private
network only, remember that restricting the
<em>destination</em> to 192.168.1.1 is more
secure than restricting the <em>source</em> for
the reasons discussed in the security section
above.)</p>

<p>The general way to do port forwarding with
iptables (which is more lightweight than setting
up some process to listen on the port and
forward connections) is this:</p>

<pre>
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d $PUBLIC_ADDRESS --dport $PUBLIC_PORT -j DNAT --to $REAL_ADDRESS:$REAL_PORT
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -s $REAL_ADDRESS --sport $REAL_PORT -j SNAT --to $PUBLIC_ADDRESS:$PUBLIC_PORT
</pre>

<p>where <tt>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</tt> and
<tt>PUBLIC_PORT</tt> are set to the public IP
address of the router and the port you want the
server to appear on, and <tt>REAL_ADDRESS</tt>
and <tt>REAL_PORT</tt> are where the server is
actually running on the local network.  Note
that this method can <strong>only</strong> make
the server visible on <strong>one</strong>
interface: <strong>either</strong> the router's
public IP address, <strong>or</strong> the
private 192.168.1.1 address, or localhost if you
use <tt>OUTPUT</tt> instead of
<tt>PREROUTING</tt>, but not more than one of
these at the same time.  If you require more
than one interface to forward to the same server
then you'll have to set up a process to listen
and forward connections, such as by connecting
<tt>inetd</tt> to <tt>nc</tt>, or even by using
<tt>ssh</tt>, which is rather overkill for a
private network but it's probably the least
difficult way to set up forwarding).</p>

<p>If you do use iptables to forward ports for
the <em>public</em> interface then you need to
set <tt>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</tt> to the IP that your
ISP gives you.  You will likely find that your
distribution's <tt>/etc/dhcp3/</tt> has a
<tt>dhclient-exit-hooks</tt> script or
<tt>dhclient-exit-hooks.d</tt> directory (see
man dhclient-script) in which you can place
commands such as:</p>

<pre class="code">
if [ $reason = BOUND -o $reason = RENEW -o $reason = REBIND -o $reason = REBOOT ]; then

  # new IP will be placed in $new_ip_address
  # may need to flush the tables (e.g. changed IP)
  iptables -t nat -F PREROUTING
  iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING

  # ... then add the rules here, using $new_ip_address

  # and finally re-add the masquerade rule
  # (because it would have been deleted by the above flush)
  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

fi
</pre>

<p>You may also need to take some care when
setting <tt>REAL_ADDRESS</tt> to make sure that
it is always the same, either by configuring
that machine manually (without DHCP) or by
noting its MAC address and giving that a
<tt>fixed-address</tt> in <tt>dhcpd.conf</tt>
(see man page for details).</p>

<p>If you use the voice-over-IP application
"Skype", it can sound better if you open a port
for it in this way and thus avoid the need for
your connections to be relayed.  For best
results open UDP as well as TCP (i.e. repeat the
above forwarding setup twice, once as-is and
once substituting <tt>-p udp</tt> for <tt>-p
tcp</tt> in both commands), and tell Skype about
the port in Tools/Options/Advanced, but don't
tell Skype until <em>after</em> the port is
open, because Skype may not save the setting if
it does not appear to work at the time.  If you
use Skype from more than one machine then you
can give each one a different public port.</p>

<h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>

<p>The above discussion of routing commands is
probably more in-depth than you need for a
temporary setup, but it is included because you
might find that your setup is actually stable
and you don't need a multi-port router after
all.  If you <em>do</em> need a multi-port
router then you can use your one-port router
settings as a reference when configuring the
multi-port version.</p>

<p>In my trials with the NSLU2, a desktop, a
laptop and a cable modem on a simple "Ethernet
splitter" unpowered hub, when the NSLU2 was
fully set up as a slug and was itself acting as
the one-port router, it often lost connectivity,
sometimes to the point of having to be rebooted
(not just disconnected and reconnected from the
network), if it processed large amounts of
traffic for too long ("too long" being anything
from seconds to minutes).  Extreme throttling of
the traffic and packet sizes did help to avoid
this, but it made the connection worse than
dial-up.  However, when the desktop PC was
acting as the one-port router on the same
network, that problem did not occur.  As is so
often the case, "Your Mileage May Vary".  But it
may at least be useful to know that, if you're
in a desperate situation, you <em>can</em> rig
up a router/firewall on a machine with only one
Ethernet port.</p>

<h1>Custom Hobbit Monitoring Using SNMP</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/colello.html">Martin Colello</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<h3>Hobbit</h3>
<p>
Working as a Unix Engineer for a large manufacturing corporation puts me in
contact with many types of systems and services, and one of the tools for
system monitoring I employ is the open source application Hobbit.
Monitoring applications make excellent early-warning systems, and can help
prevent large-scale network and server problems. In many cases, they can
warn you when things are <em>about</em> to go wrong, which is much better
than getting panicked phone calls in the middle of the night. Hobbit is a
great example of such a watchdog. Hobbit is a compiled binary replacement
for Big Brother, and it offers more functionality and improved speed over
the original. While Hobbit comes with many of the most common network and
system tests right out of the box, it is also easy to extend it to monitor
things that are specific to your environment.
</p>

<p>
I will not describe the Hobbit installation procedure here, as this is well
documented at the Hobbit <a
href="http://hobbitmon.sourceforge.net">home</a> page, instead I will be
describing one of the many custom extensions I am using in production.
</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>
<p>
Hobbit extensions can range from simple shell scripts to full-blown
compiled programs and anything in between.  As long as you have access to
the Hobbit client you can create any test you need and have the results
integrated into the Hobbit web page and alert system.  My scripting
language of choice for writing Hobbit extensions is Perl.  There is a large
repository of Hobbit/Big Brother extensions that have already been written
and contributed back to the community at <a
href="http://www.deadcat.net">http://www.deadcat.net</a>.
</p>

<h3>A Simple SNMP Monitor</h3>
<p>
Using a simple snmp command and some Perl code we can test many services
and processes that are not natively available in Hobbit.  The first step is
to determine the OID and password for the service you wish to check.  In
this article I will describe how I used this method to get the cpu
utilization from an iSeries server, which is functionality that was not
included in Hobbit out of the box.  The same principles apply to nearly
anything that can be grabbed via SNMP.  My Hobbit server runs on Solaris,
but the commands are the same for linux.  The command to get the cpu
utilization from an iseries box from the Solaris command line is "snmpget
-v1 -c password servername 1.3.6.1.4.1.2.6.4.5.1.0".  With this command in
hand, we can wrap it in a script that will report the results to the hobbit
server.
</p>

<h3>The Script</h3>
<p>
<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

# $test will be the name shown in the Hobbit web gui,
# it should be as short as possible
my $test = '400cpu';

# $bbprog is simply the name of the script
my $bbprog = '400cpu.pl';

my ($color, $line, $machine, $warn, $end, $date, $currently);
my $server='servername';

# Issue the snmp command we discussed earlier and store the
# results in $results
my $results = `/usr/local/bin/snmpget -v1 -c public wc400 1.3.6.1.4.1.2.6.4.5.1.0`;

# Split the results into an array, breaking up by spaces
my @results = split / /, $results;

# Grab just the piece we're looking for from the array, and store in $value
my $value = $results[3];
chomp($value);

# If the value comes in at 3000, that means 30 percent, so do some quick
# math on $value
$value = $value/100;
$value = int($value);

# Initially set the test color to "green", we'll turn red if needed to alert
$color = 'green';

# Set some variables to present to the Hobbit server, the first in colon format
my $percent = "\n\nPercentage : $value\n\n";
$currently = "$percent\n\nCPU ok.\n\n\n\n";

# Determine if cpu utilization is too high, if so, turn red
if ( $value &gt; 80 ) {
        $color = 'red';
        $currently = "$percent\n\nCPU Utiliaztion is high.\n\n";
                       }

# Prepare line for Hobbit server in correct format

$machine = "$server,amkor,com";

$date = `date`;
chomp($date);

$line = "status $machine.$test $color $date $currently";

system("/usr/local/hobbit/server/bin/bb hobbit_servername \"$line\"";
</pre>


<h3>Enabling the script in Hobbit</h3>
<p>
Now that we have our script ready, it's time to configure the Hobbit client
to run it once every five minutes.  Open the file clientlaunch.cfg in the
etc directory of your Hobbit home directory and add this entry:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	[400cpu.pl]<br>
	ENVFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/etc/hobbitclient.cfg<br>
	CMD $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/ext/400cpu.pl<br>
	LOGFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/logs/400cpu.pl<br>
	INTERVAL 5m<br><br>
</pre>

<p>
Now you can restart your Hobbit client, wait 10 or 15 minutes for data to
be collected, then check your Hobbit gui for output similiar to this:<br>
<img src="misc/colello/iseries.jpg" alt="iSeries Hobbit Output" width="676" height="590">
</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>
In this brief article, we've managed to create a useful Hobbit test, and
have it integrated into the Hobbit gui.  Simple variations of this
technique can be used to monitor almost any metric that can be gotten to
via snmp.

<h1>Away Mission: Sem-Tech 07 Conference, May 2007, San Jose, CA</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
The outline of next generation web technology is sharper: Web 3.0 is taking 
shape... today.
</p>

<p>
This was the third Sem-Tech conference and it was gratifying to see tools and 
projects emerging and even some early products hitting the new market for 
Semantic Technologies.  The conference focused on both research and the 
commercialization of ontologies and reasoning tools. It had Tutorials, keynotes, 
tech sessions and panels. And many developers who had previously discussed novel 
ideas were now demoing working betas.
</p>

<p>
This was something of a coming out party for semantic startups and venture 
capitalists.  Besides more business people on panels, poster sessions for 
academic and open source projects, and informal meetings in the corridors, it 
was clear that a lot of research was coming out of the lab and becoming 
productized or open-sourced. Even a giants like Yahoo proudly demoed beta web 
sites using its Webby version of sematic technology.
</p>

<p>
(<strong>Note</strong>: The second Sem-Tech conference was reviewed in <a
href="../129/dyckoff.html">LG issue #129</a>, and that article contains
definitions and discussions of the underlying technologies. Please refer to
it for the terminology of semantic technology [OWL, RDF, etc].)
<!-- 
What the hell is this? If it's a quote, who's it from? Never mind; elided.
 - Ben

"IT industry
analysts have estimated that 35-65% of our 'untamable' system integration
costs are due to semantic issues [semantic discontinuities]; this is making
the overlap of semantics and web technologies an issue of critical interest
to businesses on the cutting edge."
-->
</p>

<p>
One example of products slipping into mainstream websites is
CongnitionSearch, which is currently used as the advanced search engine at
the Lexis-Nexis Concordance service.  Dr. Kathleen Dahlberg, a professor at
UC Santa Monica and CTO and founder of Cognition, presented a session on
the underlying technolgies entitled "Improving Precision and Recall with
Lingusitic Semantics".
</p>

<p>
Cognition Technologies is a search-technology company that has created a
meaning-based evolution in text searching. Its patented architecture, known
as CognitionSearch, is able to deliver significantly more precise results,
with far greater recall, than currently used technologies. In the Medline
Demo I saw, a plain text question was parsed by the back end and the user
was presented with a small pull down menu to select the correct knowledge
domain. The results listed were quite relevant and found word matches not
in the original question [!] - e.g., a question on Hodgkin's disease found
articles on lymphoma ranked near the top. This is due to using taxonomies
to process general as well as specific concepts, so a search for "vehicle
accident" will find items on cars, buses, boats, etc.
</p>

<p>
Here is a partial screen snapshot of what the Cognition interface provides:

<h3>"The answer to your question is..."</h3>

<p>
Now let's take a look at the semantic tech efforts of the federal
government and university research supported by the <em>Disruptive
Technology Office</em> (formerly known as ARDA (Advanced Research and
Development Activity) - and I am <em>not</em> kidding).  Many of these
projects still list themselves as ARDA-supported.  Although some of the
funding comes from those notorious 3 letter agencies, most of this work was
never classified and is accessible to the general public.
</p>

<p>
The revelation here is that ARDA/DTO projects have made significant headway 
and have solved, or are solving, many difficult problems in knowledge 
representation and machine reasoning. This was the point of a dense 
presentation by Dr. Lucian Russell titled "Advanced Intelligence Community 
R&amp;D Meets the Semantic Web!"
<br>
 
<br>
"Look, the world's greatest minds tried to bring together language and
logic for 50 years and failed. Now it is possible, so as this changes
everything...."  Russell went on to describe 4 developments that enables
this paradigm shift, "It starts with English (i.e.  WordNet) because that
project (<a
href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">http://wordnet.princeton.edu/</a>)
defines the most common word meanings in the English language. Its database 
is the semantics of English." The key here is that, due to WordNet,
machine-mediated semantic analysis is possible.
</p>

<p>
Besides the availability of a well-defined vocabulary database, ARDA has 
produced these technologies:
<br>
 --  IKRIS, for the representation of 
domain-specific knowledge and inter-domain translation
<br>
 --  
AQUAINT, the system used for Advanced Question Answering for 
Intelligence
<br>
 -- TimeML,  a markup language for Temporal and 
Event expression [<a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~jamesp/arda/time/">http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~jamesp/arda/time/</a>]
</p>

<p>
According to Russell, prior to the AQUAINT projects, software systems could 
not resolve issues involving persistance and temporality, and thus could not 
read English documents.  This lead to the development of TimeML, allowing 
time stamping, event ordering, and reasoning about processes occurring over 
time, an essential part of real-world knowledge representation - that is, 
actions described by verbs.
</p>

<p>
All of these efforts matured and came to fruition at the end of 2006, and 
mark a significant advance in semantic interoperability. Together, it is now 
possible  to describe scentific knowledge in language and with logic that 
is machine readable.
</p>

<p>
AQUAINT allows a system to answer questions formulated in English based on 
the content in a repository. For this to occur, the system must parse and 
understand the question and its relationship to the repository and then find 
answers in that repository.
</p>

<p>
Javelin, a multilingual offshoot of AQUAINT being developed at CMU, is 
currently answering English questions from repositories in Chinese and Japanese. 
Recently, that research has broadened to questions that involve reasoning about 
relationships ("How did Egypt acquire SAMs?") and questions that are answered 
from multilingual sources.
</p>

<p>
IKRIS has the goal of providing for translation of Knowledge
Representations (KRs) from different domains and different contractors. It
does this by contextualizing these KRs and and allowing translation of
scenarios to support automated reasoning.  More specifically, a major goal
of IKRIS is to represent knowledge that is relevant to intelligence
analysis tasks in a form that enhances automated support for analysts.
</p>

<p>
"IKRIS is a logic system that encompasses all of the work the W3C did in
the OWL language, all of the ISO work on common logic (CL) [<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Logic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Logic</a>]
and extends that to non-monotonic logic, the logic of scientific
discovery," Russell said.  
</p>

<p>
A fuller description of AQUAINT and scenario-based analysis is here:  
[<a 
href="http://languagecomputer.com/hltnaacl04qa/HLT-NAACL-QA-Wkshp-May-04-keynote.pdf">http://languagecomputer.com/hltnaacl04qa/HLT-NAACL-QA-Wkshp-May-04-keynote.pdf</a>]
</p>

<p>
In 2005 the federal government stated that Semantic Interoperability is a 
goal. This quote comes from Chapter 3 of the federal Data Reference Model (DRM) 
documentation: "Implementing information sharing infrastructures between 
discrete content owners (even with using service-oriented architectures or 
business process modeling approaches) still has to contend with problems with 
different contexts and their associated meanings. Semantic interoperability is a 
capability that enables enhanced automated discovery and usage of data due to 
the enhanced meaning (semantics) that are provided for data."
</p>

<p>
"The federal DRM stated that Data Description and Data Context files should 
be created to enable this sharing but did not say how this would happen," 
explained Russell. "That was because in 2005 there was no way to specify 
precisely what "enhanced" meant. As of May 2006, due to the advances by 
ACQUAINT, there now is. Most important are the results from IKRIS."
</p>

<p>
One of the benefits resulting from these capabiities is a new relevance for
data descriptions and DB documentation - a stepchild in the current IT
world and thus a black hole in the IT budget. These are tedious tasks often
left undone, or significantly out of date, and hardly anybody would invest
time to read these descriptions. But now semantic and linguistic technology
can automate the conversion of DB documention into knowledge bases and
answer quesitions expressed in natural English - and these can be used to
create SOAs and to audit IT policy. A Brave New World is coming...
</p>

<p>
To achieve this knowledge automation, Russell gave Linux Gazette the 
following prescription: "The way forward is simple: write precise descriptions 
of data collections using English. The semantics of each word should be chosen 
from the meanings of the word in WordNet, augmented as needed. For databases 
with schemas, the meanings of all data attributes should be described in 
terms of the processes generating the data values that are stored in the 
database. Then input the descriptions to a software tool that extracts logical 
relations from the text." There are several of these arriving on the market
and in OSSw projects.
</p>

<p>
Russell was a co-author of the Data Reference Model, the Federal standard for 
sharing data. He has been involved with a number of unclassified R&amp;D efforts 
supporting the Intelligence Community, and helped organize the Semantic 
Interoperability Community of Practice (SICoP) Special Conferences earlier in 
2007.
</p>

<p>
Here is an earlier version of Russell's presentation as a PPT file from the 
April SiCop Conference:

</p>

<h3>Other Sem-Tech sessions</h3>

<p>
"I will not use the word semantics... if it's done right, no one will know
it's there," offered Chuck Rehberg, chief scientist at Semantic Insights.
He described their beta product that can read text bases, make inferences
and create tailored reports for individuals.    He produced reports on all
of the presidential candidates based on RSS feeds, showing how semantic
matching could generate a selective and relevant report.
</p>

<p>
Radar Networks, a startup currently in stealth mode, is building a cool
next-generation semantic application (the only thing we know with any
certainty is that it's not a search engine.) Nova Spivack, its founder,
spoke of building end user applications to help groups manage knowledge on
the web as a repository. This application is slated to go into an
invite-beta status in Fall 2007.
</p>

<p>
Nova offered this insight:  "With group information, the effort 
increases while the value of the information decreases... it's inversely 
proprotional to the number of users."  The remedy, he suggested, is a layer 
of semantic tech to help groups manage their knowledge. Said Nova 
suggestively, "We all have different file systems, email systems, informal 
knowledge bases... We need to automate that and make sense of all the 
information."  
</p>

<p>
Another insight: Radar, Vulcan, and some other semantic startups are
receiving VC funding from Paul Allen's group. Allen, a co-founder of
Microsoft turned technology incubator, is very interested in the potential
of semantic tech to intelligently link information on the web.   
</p>

<p>
One notion from a tech session on "Semantic User Experiences" by Ross Centers 
suggested a way to bridge the developing Web 2.0 universe with semantic 
technology, often called the future Web 3.0. Drawing a distinction between  
these approaches, we have a choice of 'tags' vs. formal ontologies (or, as an 
analogy, something built by web users vs. built by "teams of dwarves locked in 
mines"). Could the Wiki metaphor bridge the gap? Semantic wikis could act as a 
way for "crowds" of users to refine a shared ontology, suggested Centers.
</p>

<p>
Although there were optional tours of Adobe and Oracle to view their 
semantic products and meet their researchers, most attendees chose a full 
afternoon product seminar by TopQuadrant to conclude the conference. "Semantic 
Web Modeling and Application Development using TopBraid" was presented by Dean 
Allemang and Holger Knublauch of TopQuadrant. This mini-tutorial showed basic 
modeling in RDF-S and OWL and deployment of a semantic application using 
TopBraid Live.
</p>

<p>
Attendees built a simple mashup without having to use the underlying APIs
of Google Maps and other sites. Instead, a pre-built ontology was linked to
simple data files and back-end processes to graphically build the mashup.
In other words, the user drove a knowledge-based tool to create a dynamic,
AJAX-based application without programming. This is more than just another
level of indirection, and it worked fairly well. 
</p>

<p>
Here's a link to TopQuadrant:  <a

</p>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
The Semantic Technology conference scores well in having most presentations 
on the conference CD (including tutorials), having daily updates of missing 
presentations and printed tutorial handouts for almost all sessions.
</p>

<p>
It also scores high on the well-organized meals and snacks, although it 
could be a little more veggie-friendly. Some rooms for sessions had power cords 
for attendees, but not the main hall, leading to fierce competition for the few 
wall outlets.
</p>

<p>
It looks like the conference proceedings may not be available to the
public, since last year's CD is still a commercially-available product.
Officially, they will be posting portions of the 2006 and 2007 Semantic
Technology Conferences in July.  These files will be found on <a

<h1>Setting up an Encrypted Debian System</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p> Ever since I heard that the new Debian &#X201C;etch&#X201D; installer supports
encrypted LVM, I wanted to try having an encrypted disk. Given recent
news stories about loss of identity information from stolen laptops,
it is certainly not paranoid to want to do this &#X2014; and if you tell
me otherwise you are probably one of those guys trying to steal my
identity information!
</p>

<p> One way would have been to re-install Debian on my laptop from a Debian
install CD after saving all my data &#X2014; but I can already hear
sarcastic clucking sounds to the accompaniment of flapping arms folded at
the elbows if I even <em>think</em> this way. The whole point of the
exercise would be <b>lost</b> if I have to re-configure my laptop all over
again. So here goes!
</p>

<h2 class="section">Axioms</h2>
<p> 
Let me first describe the disk configuration that I like to have as it
might be a bit unusual. Ever since I learnt about <tt>dmsetup</tt> and
the Linux Device Mapper stuff, my system has had just two partitions:
</p>

<ul class="itemize">
<li class="li-itemize">
<tt>/dev/hda1</tt> which is a small (50-100MB) partition for <tt>/boot</tt>. 
</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><tt>/dev/hda2</tt> which is the rest of the disk and is used
through the device mapper.
</li>
</ul>

<p> 
This allows me to resize filesystems as and when required. Since
Debian &#X201C;sarge&#X201D; I have used the Linux Volume Manager (LVM) rather
than <code>dmsetup</code> to handle this second part. LVM makes it easier to
avoid mistakes while configuring the device mapper.
</p>

<p> If your current setup is a more &#X201C;standard&#X201D; one that consists of a
number of partitions for different purposes, don't worry. As part
of the process, your machine too will be configured the same
way. <em>&#X201C;We are the Borg. Your devices will also be mapped out!&#X201D;</em>
</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Backups Are Important</h3>
<p> 
I <em>do</em> need to assume that you have a backup disk that has enough
space to hold a copy of your entire system. You don't?! Then let's
assume that you have a partition that has enough space to hold a copy
of your entire system. What?! You used up all 40GB of diskspace and
don't even have a backup!!
</p>

<p> In that case, <b>stop</b> reading this article until you have gone and
bought yourself that additional disk space. We won't go anywhere. Come
right here after you get ready to backup before your system breaks.
</p>

<h2 class="section">Making Space in the Boot</h2>
<p> 
So let us assume that <tt>/dev/sda</tt> contains enough free space to
keep a copy of your entire system. This is probably an external USB
disk and requires a little more care while booting.
</p>

<p> The first step in creating a bootable backup is to install all the
tools we will need <em>after</em> we re-boot:
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        apt-get install cryptsetup lvm2 initramfs-tools grub
        apt-get install linux-image-2.6-686 
</pre>

<p> In particular, we will use the stock Debian kernel and the stock Debian
boot system (<tt>grub</tt>+<tt>initrd</tt>). The order of the
<tt>install</tt> commands is important since we want to make sure that the
scripts to handle encrypted and/or LVM disks get installed in the
<tt>initrd</tt>. In case you already have the stock Debian kernel installed
you should run
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        update-initramfs -u
</pre>
<p> instead of the second step above. 
</p>

<p> Next, we partition the disk <tt>/dev/sda</tt> with a scheme like that above: 
</p>

<ul class="itemize">
<li class="li-itemize">
<tt>/dev/sda1</tt> a big enough partition to contain a copy of <tt>/boot</tt>. 
</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><tt>/dev/sda2</tt> is the rest. 
</li>
</ul>

<p> 
Next, create a regular ext2 file system on <tt>/dev/sda1</tt>.
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        mke2fs -L Boot /dev/sda1
</pre>

<p> We now setup the other partition as an encrypted LVM partition. 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        crypsetup luksFormat /dev/sda2 
</pre>

<p> This will ask for a passphrase which will be used to create a Linux
Unified Key Setup (LUKS) partition. The partition header of a LUKS
parition contains information on how the disk is to be decrypted using
a key that is generated using the passphrase.
</p>

<p> <em>
This passphrase is </em><em><b>very</b></em><em> important. If you forget
it you can forget about all the data in this partition. If you lose it and
someone else finds it they can get all the data in this partition.
</em>
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Writing it down on a Post-It note and sticking it to
your screen would make a useful reminder... or maybe saving a copy on that
newly-encrypted filesystem would be even better. :) If, for some silly
reason, you decide that you don't want to follow these time-honored
practices, then you might consider saving this password in several places
 - securely - to prevent loss. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p> Next, we get ready to use this partition with the command 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 backup
</pre>

<p> This creates <tt>/dev/mapper/backup</tt> as a block device containing
the unencrypted version of the partition. We will carve this up using
LVM2. The commands
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        pvcreate /dev/mapper/backup
        vgcreate vgb /dev/mapper/backup
</pre>

<p> create an LVM volume group called <tt>vgb</tt> which will contain the
various filesystems. Commands like
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        lvcreate -n root -L 3G vgb
        lvcreate -n swap -L 2G vgb
        lvcreate -n home -L 10G vgb
</pre>

<p> can be used to create the block devices <tt>/dev/vgb/root</tt>,
etc. These can be prepared as usual
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        mkswap -L Swap /dev/vgb/swap
        mke2fs -j -L Root /dev/vgb/root
        mke2fs -j -L Home /dev/vgb/home
</pre>

<h2 class="section">A Filling</h2>
<p> 
Well, most of you know the drill, but let me repeat it anyway. First
create the empty target tree with commands like
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        mkdir /tmp/target
        mount /dev/vgb/root /tmp/target
        mkdir /tmp/target/{boot,home}
        mount /dev/vgb/home /tmp/target/home
        mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/target/boot
</pre>
<p> Next, copy the files without looping, 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        find . -wholename '/tmp/target' -prune -o -print  | cpio -pdum /tmp/target 
</pre>
<p> &#X2026;and go find that cup of coffee with your name written on it. If
you are like Chance the gardener in <em>Being There</em> and &#X201C;like to
watch&#X201D;, then change the <tt>-pdum</tt> to <tt>-pdumv</tt>.
</p>

<p> Finally, just look through the directory <tt>/tmp/target</tt> and make
sure that you have copied everything properly. This completes the
encrypted backup of your system.
</p>

<h2 class="section">Making the Backup Bootable</h2>
<p> The first step is to install
<tt>grub</tt> into the boot record of <tt>/dev/sda</tt>
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        grub-install --root-directory /tmp/target /dev/sda
</pre>
<p> After this you <em>may</em> want to replace the <tt>device.map</tt> file created 
by <code>grub</code>
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        echo '(hd0) /dev/sda' &gt; /tmp/target/boot/grub/device.map
</pre>
<p> We also want the <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> to reflect the new filesystem structure 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        pushd /tmp/target/etc
        mv fstab fstab.orig
        cat &gt; fstab &lt;&lt;EOF
        LABEL=Root      /       ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1
        LABEL=Swap      swap    swap defaults   0 0
        LABEL=Boot      /boot   ext2 defaults   0 1
        LABEL=Home      /home   ext3 defaults   0 2
        EOF
        popd
</pre>
<p> You may want to add the information on how this disk is encrypted 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        cat &gt;&gt; /tmp/target/etc/crypttab &lt;&lt;EOF
        backup  /dev/sda2       none    luks
        EOF
</pre>
<p> Finally, we need to create the boot instructions for <tt>grub</tt>. Begin
by editing the file <tt>/tmp/target/boot/grub/menu.lst</tt> at the line
that starts with <tt># kopt=</tt> and append to it so that the line
reads like
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        # kopt=ro root=/dev/mapper/vgb-root
           cryptopts=source=/dev/sda2,target=backup,lvm=vgb-root 
           rootdelay=10
</pre>
<p> This is all in <b>one</b> line and has been line wrapped for
readability. The <tt>rootdelay=10</tt> option gives 10 seconds for the
USB disk to be recognised by the Debian boot process; you may need
more (or less) time on your system.
</p>

<p> You may add options like <tt>vga=791</tt> to enable the default VESA
framebuffer and so on. Just remember to add these to the <b>same</b>
line.
</p>

<p> Then incorporate this changed configuration into the boot process
for <code>grub</code>
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        chroot /tmp/target update-grub
</pre>
<p> We now unmount the whole mess. 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        umount /tmp/target/home
        umount /tmp/target/boot
        umount /tmp/target
</pre>
<p> Then disable the LVM:
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        vgchange -an vgb
</pre>
<p> Remove the decrypted block device:
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        cryptsetup remove backup
</pre>
<p> Now, you can safely detach your external USB disk.
</p>

<p> And there you have an encrypted bootable backup. It is possible that
your laptop does not boot from USB hard disks. In that case you need
create a &#X201C;grub boot floppy&#X201D; if you want this backup to be bootable!
</p>

<h2 class="section">Keeping Up-to-Date</h2>
<p> 
This is rather easy using <tt>rsync</tt>. 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        apt-get install rsync
</pre>

<p> The command would then be something like 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        rsync -aW --exclude=/tmp/target \
          --exclude=/boot \
          --exclude=/etc/fstab \
          /. /tmp/target/.
</pre>

<p> You also need to re-run the <tt>grub-install</tt> command if you do not
exclude <code>/boot</code> from the backup. Just to avoid blaming your typing
finger you may want to create a script to mount the target, perform
the <tt>rsync</tt> and unmount the target.
</p>

<h2 class="section">And Repeat</h2>
<p> 
Of course, this still leaves you open to loss of identity information
if your laptop is stolen. So you just boot your newly created
encrypted bootable backup (you need to do that anyway to test it!) and
repeat the above steps with <code>/dev/sda</code> replaced with <code>/dev/hda</code>. You
might also want to replace labels like <code>backup</code> with <code>laptop</code> and
<code>vgb</code> with <code>vg</code> to avoid confusing yourself and your system. You
should probably skip the <tt>rootdelay</tt> option in this case since you
are booting from the internal disk.
</p>

<p> One advantage of converting to LVM is that you can take more
&#X201C;authentic&#X201D; backups by using &#X201C;snapshot&#X201D; images of your system
instead of doing a back up while the system is &#X201C;live&#X201D;.
</p>

Kapil Hari Paranjape has been a ``hack''-er since his punch-card days.

He has merely tinkered with programs written by others. After playing

``genuine'' *nix kernel for the x86 class of machines. Luckily for him a
certain L. Torvalds got there first---thereby saving him the trouble
(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those

<h1>Encrypted Storage with LUKS, RAID and LVM2</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Some people have a need for storing data securely. Sometimes this means not only redundant
disks (and a good backup strategy) but also encryption. Fortunately, the Linux kernel has
all the features to use multiple RAID devices, pool them to a Logical Volume, and encrypt
every block of the filesystem. Just don't forget your passphrase!
</p>

<h2>
Creating RAID devices
</h2>

<p>
The first step involves the creation of a Linux software RAID device. For the sake of
simplicity we will stick to RAID level 1, i.e. mirroring two disks or disk partitions.
A RAID1 can be done with any two (or more) parts of block devices that have the same size.
Usually you mark these partitions when installing the system. The installers of most
GNU/Linux distributions have an editor that allows you to do this. We will assume that
we already have a system, and prepare four partitions for the use of two RAID1 devices.
You simply have to edit the partition table. I like to use the <tt>cfdisk</tt> tool
for that.
<pre>
osiris:~# cfdisk /dev/sdc
</pre>
Prepare your partitions and mark them with the type code <b>FD</b>. This code marks the
partitions as <i>Linux RAID autodetect</i> and allows the system to activate them at
boot time. Remember, all the partitions should be of the same size.
<pre>
osiris:~# cfdisk /dev/sdd
</pre>
I chose <tt>/dev/sdc1</tt> and <tt>/dev/sdd1</tt>. Now let's create the RAID. You will
need the <tt>mdadm</tt> tool for this.
<pre>
osiris:~# mdadm --create /dev/md6 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
</pre>
After pressing enter the kernel creates the device and starts synchronising the
blocks. You can check the progress of this operation by looking into <tt>/proc/mdstat</tt>.
This file gives you status of all RAID devices in the system.
<pre>
osiris:~# cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [raid1] 
md1 : active raid1 sdb2[1] sda2[0]
      3903680 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md5 : active raid1 sdb3[1] sda3[0]
      4883648 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md2 : active raid1 sdb5[1] sda5[0]
      1951744 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md4 : active raid1 sdb7[1] sda7[0]
      297435328 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md6 : active raid1 sdd1[1] sdc1[0]
      488383936 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md0 : active raid1 sdb1[1] sda1[0]
      489856 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
unused devices: <none>
osiris:~#
</pre>
If you see an output like this, the RAID devices are in a consistent state. The
<tt>mdadm</tt> packages provides utilities for monitoring the state of RAIDs.
This is very useful otherwise you may not notice when your disks and your RAID
is dying.
</p>
<p>
Now create a second RAID device. I use <tt>/dev/md4</tt> from the output above
as the second device to be added to our encrypted logical volume.
</p>

<h2>
Encrypting the Block Devices
</h2>

<p>
Our tool of choice will be <tt>cryptsetup</tt> for enabling encryption. Before you
use block devices as encrypted storage, it is recommended that you overwrite them
with random bit patterns. The easiest way to do this is by using <tt>dd</tt>.
<pre>
osiris:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/md4
osiris:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/md6
</pre>
Depending on your hardware this can take several hours. Make sure not to use
<tt>/dev/random</tt> or these commands will take several days or weeks. You don't
have to do this. However if you leave any recognisable pattern on the device,
it is easier to spot the encrypted blocks, and concentrate code breaking on them.
</p>
<p>
After your disks have been overwritten with random garbage you can encrypt them.
<pre>
osiris:~# cryptsetup -c aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 -y -s 256 luksFormat /dev/md4
osiris:~# cryptsetup -c aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 -y -s 256 luksFormat /dev/md6
</pre>
Make sure you don't forget your passphrase! If you forget it, your data is pretty
secure and unrecoverable. Bear in mind encrypting data and throwing the keys away 
is the industrial standard for data destruction (of course assuming that you are
using something better than ROT13 or XOR). The block devices are now ready for
encryption.
</p>
<p>
The commands above initialise the devices for use with the AES algorithm. The key
length is 256 bit, and we use a method called ESSIV or <i>E(Sector|Salt)</i> in order
to avoid weaknesses in the choice of initial values for the encryption algorithm.
</p>

<h2>
Unlocking the Block Devices
</h2>

<p>
Every time you wish to use your encrypted block devices you have to unlock them.
That's the idea. Unlocking can also be done with <tt>cryptsetup</tt>.
<pre>
osiris:~# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md4 crypt1
osiris:~# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md6 crypt2
</pre>
You will be prompted for your passphrase. After unlocking, the devices can
be accessed by using <tt>/dev/mapper/crypt1</tt> and <tt>/dev/mapper/crypt2</tt>.
Note that we won't use the RAID devices directly anymore. We access the storage
space through an encryption layer. The data stored in the blocks of our RAID
is encrypted.
</p>

<h2>
Pooling Block Devices into a Logical Volume
</h2>

<p>
The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a tool for combining multiple physical
block devices into volume groups, and for creating logical volumes out of them.
The LVM2 has its own HOWTO where everything is explained in great
detail. We only need to know how the storage areas are organised. The order is
as follows.
<ol>
<li> Physical extents (block devices, partitions)</li>
<li> Volume groups (consisting of physical extents)</li>
<li> Logical volumes (combining parts of volume groups)</li>
</ol>
So far we have only the RAID devices which correspond to the lowest layer of the LVM2.
We still need to create physical extents, assign them to a volume group and create
a logical volume. Filesystems can only reside on these logical volumes. The following
figure illustrates how the different storage layers are connected.<br>
<img src="misc/pfeiffer/lvm2.png" width="624" height="244" alt="LVM2 diagram">
</p>
<p>
Ok, so let's mark our encrypted RAID1 devices as physical extents and create a volume
group.
<pre>
osiris:~# pvcreate /dev/mapper/crypt1
osiris:~# pvcreate /dev/mapper/crypt2
osiris:~# vgcreate -v cryptvg /dev/mapper/crypt1 /dev/mapper/crypt2
</pre>
The commands <tt>pvscan</tt> and <tt>vgdisplay</tt> shows you the result of the commands
above. The <tt>vgdisplay</tt> is especially useful since it shows you the number of
physical extents available in a volume group. We now want to use the complete
volume group <tt>cryptvg</tt> for a logical volume. Therefore we tell <tt>lvcreate</tt>
the number of extents to use.
<pre>
osiris:~# lvcreate -l 191849 -n backuplv cryptvg
</pre>
That's all we need. Our new logical volume can now be accessed by the device file 
<tt>/dev/backup/backuplv</tt>. We format this device with an XFS filesystem (of course you
can use whatever filesystem you wish, XFS is just an example).
<pre>
osiris:~# mkfs.xfs -d agcount=48 -L backup /dev/backup/backuplv
</pre>
That's it. We can now mount this volume and use it as we like. Don't forget
to write an entry for your <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> in order to have all mount options
ready. A possible configuration would be like this one:
<pre>
/dev/backup/backuplv /backup xfs ikeep,noatime 0 0
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
Mounting and umounting 
</h2>

<p>
You have to do some steps to activate and deactive your new encrypted volume. Most
things will be taken care of by the Linux kernel (such as autodetecting the RAID
devices and starting them). Some things can't be taken care of automatically.
Here is a simple script that does all the necessary steps.
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

echo "Unlocking /dev/md4"
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md4 crypt1
echo "Unlocking /dev/md6"
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md6 crypt2
echo "Scanning for volume groups"
vgscan --mknodes
vgchange -ay
echo "Mounting /backup"
mount /backup
</pre>
<tt>cryptsetup</tt> will ask you once per RAID device for your passphrase(s).
The shutdown sequence is the reverse order.
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

umount /backup
# Mark the logical volume INACTIVE (can be restored with 'lvchange -ay')
lvchange -an backuplv
# Mark the volume group INACTIVE (can be restored with 'vgchange -ay')
vgchange -an cryptvg
cryptsetup remove crypt1
cryptsetup remove crypt2
</pre>


Most GNU/Linux distributions have start/stop scripts that can take care of
the activation and deactivation sequences. Nevertheless it's good to know
how to do it (maybe for cases when the system isn't available anymore).
</p>

<h2>
Important: Field Tests
</h2>

<p>
Now that your new shiny encrypted logical volume is empty, you have a once in a lifetime
chance of <b>testing</b> the storage mechanism. Don't miss to do this! Try simulating
a disk failure. Switch off the power and reboot. Do a filesystem check. Create
thousands of files and delete them. Copy loads of big ISO images. Do whatever
could happen to your storage and see if your data is still there. XFS' <tt>mkfs</tt>
command has the <tt>-p</tt> switch that allows you to populate a freshly created
XFS filesystem with files and directories according to a prewritten description
of the filesystem layout. This is a very useful feature for testing.
Use it. Simulate everything that can go wrong. When you are satisfied with your testing,
put your valuable data on it. And always keep backups.

Dana Blankenhorn's story <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=1123">How far can open source CRM get?</a>

"When is the OSI going to stand up to companies who are flagrantly

<p>
I am not going to start by flaming Dana.  As President of the <a>Open Source Initiative</a>,
I feel a certain amount of responsibility for stewardship of the open

protection of the brand. The topic of "what is really open source and
what is not?" has been simmering for quite some time. And until last
year the question was trivial to answer, and the answer provided a
trivial fix. But things have changed, and its time to regain our turf.
</p>

<p>
I have been on the board of the OSI for more than 5 years, and until
last year it was fairly easy for us to police the term open source:
once every 2-3 months we'd receive notice that some company or another
was advertising that their software was "open source" when the license
was not approved by the OSI board and, upon inspection, was clearly not
open source. We (usually <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/board.html">Russ Nelson</a>) would send them a notice politely telling them "We are the Open Source Initiative.  We wrote a <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd">definition</a>
of what it means to be open source, we promote that definition, and
that's what the world expects when they see the term mentioned. Do you
really want to explain to your prospective customers 'um...we don't
actually intend to offer you these freedoms and rights you expect?'."
And they would promptly respond by saying "Wow! We had no idea!" Maybe
once or twice they would say "What a novel idea! We'll change our
license to one that's approved by you!". Most of the time they would
say "Oops! Thanks for letting us know--we'll promote our software in
some other way." And they did, until last year.
</p>

<p>
Starting around 2006, the term open source came under attack from
two new and unanticipated directions: the first was from vendors who
claimed that they have every bit as much right to define the term as
does the OSI, and the second was from vendors who claimed that their
license was actually faithful to the <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd">Open Source Definition</a>
(OSD), and that the OSI board was merely being obtuse (or worse) in not
recognizing that fact. (At least one vendor has pursued both lines of
attack.) This was certainly not the first attack we ever had to repel,
but it is the first time we have had to confront agents who fly our
flag as their actions serve to corrupt our movement. The time has come
to bring the matter into the open, and to let the democratic light of
the open source community illuminate for all of us the proper answer.
</p>

<p>
Dana reports correctly when he says:
</p>

<p>
Then there's open source, the only way in which CRM start-ups can elbow their way into the market today.
</p>

<p>
And so it is for numerous classes of applications and numerous
software markets. But I disagree completely with his next statement,
which is logical but also fallacious:
</p>

<p>
SugarCRM, SplendidCRM and now Centric have proven [sic] there's a
place in the market for this (if you read your license carefully).
</p>

<p>
It is logical precisely because there really is not room in the
market for Yet Another Proprietary CRM system. It is fallacious because
<em>THESE LICENSES ARE NOT OPEN SOURCE LICENSES</em>.  This flagrant abuse of labeling is not unlike sweetening a mild abrasive with ethylene glycol and calling the substance <a href="http://archive.gulfnews.com/nation/Health/10129845.html">Toothpaste</a>.
If the market is clamouring for open source CRM solutions, why are some
companies delivering open source in name only and not in substance? I
think the answer is simple: they think they can get away with it. As
President of the OSI, I've been remiss in thinking that gentle but firm
explanations would cause them to change their behavior. I have also not
chased down and attempted to correct every reporter who propagates
these misstatements (the way that Richard Stallman does when people
confuse free software with free beer, or worse--to him--open source). I
have now come to realize that if we don't call them out, then they will
get away with it (at least until customers realize they've been fooled
again, and then they'll blame both proprietary <em>and</em> open
source vendors alike; they probably won't be particularly charitable
with the press or careless industry analysts, either). If we don't
respond to those in the press who fall (or are pushed) into these
logical traps, we are betraying the community.
</p>

<p>
So here's what I propose: let's all agree--vendors, press, analysts,
and others who identify themselves as community members--to use the
term 'open source' to refer to software licensed under an OSI-approved
license. If no company can be successful by selling a CRM solution
licensed under an OSI-approved license, then OSI (and the open source
movement) should take the heat for promoting a model that is not
sustainable in a free market economy. We can treat that case as a bug,
and together we can work (with many eyes) to discern what it is about
the existing open source definition or open source licenses made CRM a
failure when so many other applications are flourishing. But just
because a CEO thinks his company will be <em>more</em> successful by
promoting proprietary software as open source doesn't teach anything
about the true value of open source. Hey--if people want to try
something that's not open source, great! But let them call it something
else, as Microsoft has done with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/default.mspx">Shared Source</a>.
We should never put the customer in a position where they cannot trust
the term open source to mean anything because some company and their
investors would rather make a quick buck than an honest one, or because
they believe more strongly in their own story than the story we've been
creating together for the past twenty years. We are better than that.
We have been successful over the past twenty years because we have been
better than that. We have built a well-deserved reputation, and we
shouldn't allow others to trade the reputation we earned for a few
pieces of silver.
</p>

<p>
Open Source has grown up. Now it is time for us to stand up. I
believe that when we do, the vendors who ignore our norms will suddenly
recognize that they really do need to make a choice: to label their
software correctly and honestly, or to license it with an OSI-approved
license that matches their open source label. And when they choose the
latter, I'll give them a shout out, <a href="http://opensource.org/node/109">as history shows</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please join me, stand up, and make your voice heard--enough is enough.

Our Geekword Puzzle editor, Sam Bisbee, has now gone off to become the
Wizard-in-Residence to some lucky company - which means that he will no
longer have the time to create the GP. Great for them... less so for us,
although we certainly wish Sam the best of luck. Dear readers, if you know
someone who is a puzzlemaster (is that the right word?), please steer them
in our direction; the Geekword is something we'd hate to lose as a feature.
This is yet another way you can give back to the Linux community - not
something you'd normally expect from that skillset!

<em>
<p>
Sam was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA area. His interest in all
things electronic was established early by his electrician father and database
designer mother. Teaching himself HTML and basic web design at the age of 10,
Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science and the
FOSS community. His first Linux install was Red Hat, which he installed on a
Pentium 233GHz i686 when he was about 13. He found his way into the computer
club in high school at Northfield Mount Hermon, a New England boarding school,
which was lovingly named GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and
Science. This venue allowed him to share in and teach the Linux experience to
fellow students and teachers alike. Late in high school Sam was abducted into
the Open and Free Technology Community, had his first article published, and
became more involved in the FOSS community as a whole. After a year at 
Boston University he decided the experience was not for him, striking out on
his own as a software developer and contractor.

&gt; Is linux susceptible to root kits?

<p>
Rootkits (i.e., kits of software designed to hide an intruder's
presence) are a minor after-effect of system security compromise that
has already occurred through other means entirely.  Your question is
similar to asking: "Are houses susceptible to being burned down?",
because you heard of a case where a house was left derelict for years,
the front door rotted, vagrants moved in and trashed the place for a
couple of more years, and finally one of them dropped a match.

<pre>
&gt; The recent talk of these as ways of attacking pc's and the Sony
&gt; debacle has left me wondering.  Apart from regularly updating my
&gt; system, is there a way I can check that I haven't been compromised (if
&gt; 10.1 is at risk)?
</pre>

<p>
You actually ask a profound question:  How do you <em>ever</em> know for
certain that a system hasn't been compromised by unauthorised parties?
The literal answer is:  You can't.  A slightly more useful answer from
Marcus J. Ranum is that you minimise the likelihood of compromise this
way:  1. Don't use software that sucks.  2. Absolutely minimise 
Internet-facing network services your system offers.

Hi, folks -
</p>

<p>
Just FYI, I have the minor inconvenience of a hurricane heading for me,
and (theoretically) approaching my neighborhood just about the time that
I'm supposed to be publishing LG this month. I'm hoping to <strong>not</strong> have to
either a) publish LG from 30,000 feet without a plane or b) miss pubbing
on the 1st, but it's looking iffy at the moment.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;From the National Weather Service:

FORECAST VALID 30/1200Z 26.6N  80.4W...INLAND
MAX WIND  70 KT...GUSTS  85 KT.
50 KT... 50NE  50SE  25SW  25NW.
34 KT...120NE 120SE  50SW  50NW.

FORECAST VALID 31/1200Z 31.0N  80.0W
MAX WIND  75 KT...GUSTS  90 KT.
50 KT... 50NE  50SE  30SW  50NW.
34 KT...120NE 120SE  75SW  90NW.
</pre>

<p>
So, the current prediction is that around 1000 Zulu on the 31st (i.e.,
~3a.m. EST on the 1st), the center of the hurricane - which will be
blowing about 75 knots steady and gusting 90 knots - is going to visit
my neighborhood (29.9N 81.3W).
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, I recently bought a large anchor and some chain for
it. On the minus side, my engine is down for service at the moment, and
getting the boat to a hurricane hole without an engine is problematic,
to say the least. I'll be beavering away on that latter problem, and
keeping track of Ernesto as it spins its way toward me...
