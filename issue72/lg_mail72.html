Hi,
</P>
<P>
I have been searching through the Linux Gazette website for anyting on the industry average of call handling times for Linux support.  So far I have not found anything.
</P>
<P>
I was wondering if you had done an article or come across this.  I was wondering if there were any industry documents that measured the average time it would take a customer to call in for support till the time that their problem was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Any information that you may have would be very helpful.
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
Darlene

Hello eveyone at the gazette I've been all over the net trying to find
out the answer about problem im having I have an Efficient Networks 4060
USB Modem . I want to run Mandrake 8.1 but dont know if there any
drivers or if they even exist.maybe you guys can help me with any info
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Lots of people have been caught with DSL USB modems without Linux

best bet may be to return it for an external modem that connects to
an Ethernet card.  These are much more Linux-friendly.

I am new to Linux and am desperate to solve 2 problems.  I run a new
Evesham PC with a 1.4GHz Athlon chip, NVIDIA GeForce 2MX graphics card
with a Taxan crystal vision 680 TCO99-S monitor.
</P>
<P>
When I boot my <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.1 installation 
from the floppy, the boot process
hangs at 'setting up CMOS clock'.  I have to hit the restet button, boot
Windows, shut down Windows and restart Linux.  I other words, I cannot
get Linux to boot sucessfully twice in a row. I have to boot WIndows in
between.
</P>
<P>
My second problem is with XFree86 ver4.0.2.  The windowing system seems
to have a mind of its own.  Usually when I arrive at the graphical
login, the scree is offset about 2 inches to the right.  If I go into
Sax2 to configure using Xfine the screen display will 'snap' into place
when I stick with the 600x800 setting.  When I come out of Sax2
sometimes the setting will be saved.  Sometimes the virtual desktop
space is larger that the actual resolution setting.  If I try to
configure for 1024x768, this does not work at all.  On the limited
occasion I have got an 800x600 screen set up successfully, if I shut
down and reboot, the same problem reappears even thought I have
apparantly saved the settings.

My pupils are different than the healthy children so I have to do

So lately I have started to learn them the Linux system at school. Now
we've got only Linux in our laboratory.

At the moment I'm looking for some posters or calendars or

So if you can help me please write how can I get these things which I
wrote before or how can I buy them.
Thanks a lot for helping me.

<P>
I need to set up a RH Linux 7.1 system to automatically mount exported NFS
filesystems on the fly.  I realize the security implications inherint in
such a request, but require the functionality despite the dangers right
now.  On my Unix boxes I could simply add a line in the auto_master file
"<TT>/net -hosts -soft,noac</TT>" and set a couple of flags in the nfsconf file
(<tt>AUTOFS=3D1, NFS_CLIENT=3D1, NFS_SERVER=3D1</tt>) and everything works fine.
I've tried this on the Linux box without success.  Is there something I'm
missing?

Thanks in advance,

Hi!
Does anyone know how we can set quota to some directory for eg
/info/software
to limit say 50mb.I went through the man pages but was unsuccessfull in
setting the same.
</P>
<P>
Pls help
</P>

Thanks

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Quotas are usually by userid, aren't they?
The only thing that I can think of is creating a filesystem image of ext2

effectively would make a great article... especially if you have some real
world examples that get solved.  Making enterprise Linux a little more fun?

Dear LinuxGazette,
</P>
<P>
I have been reading your article "A need for Documentation". Very
interesting article.
</P>
<P>
I have made a 
<A HREF="http://levy.dyn.dhs.org">Linux documentation website project</A>.
Why I hear people say we need documentation,
there no lots of good documents, etc.? Im trying to advertise my Linux
documentation project for lots of time, but no one reply me. I think that I
made a really good work in this documentation website. Im trying to tell
websites like you, LinuxGazette, to get my documents and give them to the
Linux community, but I get no reply from that sites. Maybe the need of
documents isnt so urgent.
</P>
<P>
Please, check my website.
I think there are good guides for variety of
Linux subjects. I think they can help the Linux community in the search for
good documentation in the net. I will really appreciate your interest in
my project. Thank you very much.
</P>

In Issue 69 of the LinuxGazette
(<A HREF="../issue69/lg_answer69.html#tag/greeting"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue69/issue69.html</A>) 
Heather Stern recommends
using Dialog over Whiptail, implying that Whiptail is brain-damaged. Having
just started to play with Whiptail (and having never done much scripting,
and none with Dialog), I was just wondering if she might expound on this a
bit more. I did a google search and a dogpile search for "whiptail versus
dialog", and this article was about the only relevant hit I found, so as of
now Heather's recommendation is all I have to go on.

Thanks!

Hi Kent!

<blockquote>
There are at this point a large handful of variants which branched off from
Dialog 0.60 or so.  The one in the Debian version (0.9a) is actively
maintained; it had at some time been in the hands of a different linux
flavor, which I wouldn't know except it was mentioned in the examples.
I consider whiptail wimpy because its features are not nearly as complete.
With dialog, I can actually do some very cool things with the <CODE>--and-widget</CODE>
feature, and the progress-bar gadget can be convinced to work.  Essentially
I see whiptail as having made a pot shot at being dialog-compatible, but
working from an old revision, and at the time I wrote that article, I was
fuming about it because it was being strange about screen sizing.  my
annoyance was made greater by the fact I couldn't get rid of the stupid package
since the debian base expected it for something, even though I had dialog
installed.  I think that's fixed, these days.  Anyway, there's a decent
amount of history at: <A HREF="http://www.AdvancedResearch.org/dialog"

There is a bit of common misinformation about the Dmitry Sklyarov
DMCA case in the October News Bytes.
</P>
<P>
It says, "Companies are using [DMCA] to ... jail a foreign programmer
for writing (in his home country) a program that is legal in his home
country."
</P>
<P>
Sklyarov was arrested on suspicion of distributing that program in the
United States, not for writing it.

The most strenuous supporters of DMCA do not claim it should outlaw
writing of software when done outside the US.

According to the EFF FAQ at
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/US_v_Sklyarov/us_v_sklyarov_faq.html#ProsecutionQuestions"
	>http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/US_v_Sklyarov/us_v_sklyarov_faq.html#ProsecutionQuestions</A>
the charges are both that he "trafficked" in the device and "aided and
abetted" his company in doing so.  We don't know how the prosecutor will
word his case, but he could claim that writing code is "aiding and abetting".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
He could.  But since he hasn't yet, it's really putting words in his
mouth to say that Sklyarov was arrested for writing a program. -Bryan
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike] 
No more misleading than to say, as you did,
"Sklyarov was arrested on suspicion of distributing that program
in the United States."  When did he distribute it?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Better to say he was arrested for trafficking.  But even if he argues that
writing the program alone was aiding and abetting its importation into
the US, it's misleading to say he was jailed for writing a program.
That's like saying that a person who shot someone to death was jailed
for discharging a firearm.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike] 
So we agree that he was not arrested for selling/soliciting/giving away
the program during this trip.  So when did he distribute it?  The US
jurisdictional claim rests on the web site, so they would have to show
he was somehow involved with it, or that by his association with the
company he was indirectly involved.  His only role seems to be writing
the program.  Thus, why I say he was arrested "for" writing it.
I just don't like the overemphasis on distribution/trafficking in
some accounts, because it suggests Dmitry had more involvement in
that end of things than we have reason to believe.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dmitry was in the US to give a talk at a conference, not to sell a
program.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Right.  The other common misconception of the case is that Sklyarov
was arrested for something he did on his trip to the US.  Again, the
authorities have made no such claim.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
I can read this two different ways.  Either you are being sarcastic when
you say "Right" and you are declaring the statement that he was here to
speak at a conference, to be a misconception... which if so, has at least
some fallacy to it, as he <EM>was</EM> definitely here to present at a conference.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Or, you are agreeing that he was arrested for something he didn't do in the
US, which means that your disagreement with our point of view is merely that
you believe they had the right (perhaps the duty) to snap him up like that,
and we don't.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By the way the analogy would be closer to saying that the designer of a
certain variety of bullet shells was being held on charges that bullets
are used to murder people, never minding that they are also used to hunt
dangerous vermin and for food gathering in rural areas, including the rural
areas of other countries where one really does have to hunt for food, and
in areas where gun-toting is legally mandated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dmitry didn't "murder" anyone's eBook.  (Hmm, he might have dissected several,
but it is likely provable that he had Rights to the copies in question.)
It's still as illegal as ever to clone a readable book, e- or otherwise,
without having been granted the right-to-copy.  It's legal to own hammers
but not to smash unconsenting people's windows with them.  I recommend that
you read the Copyright act in better detail:
<A HREF="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17"
	>http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17</A>  There are a
number of rights <EM>explicitly</EM> granted to libraries, which may not be
implementable if the DMCA is allowed its broadest scope.  That, I'd say,
is a bug.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike] 
The DMCA's supporters would like to see it applied worldwide in any
way they can.  This can be by claiming US jurisdiction or by getting
it written into international treaties and other countries' laws.
California has a "long-arm" law under which it claims jurisdiction for
any web site which is accessible to a Californian, whether or not the
site is located in California.  This concept will continue to be pushed
and pushed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Granted, the Department of Justice did not go that far in
the Sklyarov case.  It merely claimed that because ElcomSoft had a web
site in the US selling the product, that was enough for US jurisdiction.
Of course ElcomSoft had already shut down the site voluntarily at Adobe's
"request" before this brou-ha-ha happened, and there's no allegation that
Dmitry was personally involved in that site or that he is an officer or
marketing directory for ElcomSoft rather than just a programmer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, the DMCA supporters may reluctantly accept that it cannot be applied
outside the US, but that doesn't make them stop trying to extend its
reach.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I haven't seen this.  Statements I've seen by supporters indicate they
want it applied the same way a country's laws traditionally are
applied vis a vis other countries.  I don't see anything new or
anything unique to the US.  But maybe I haven't been reading radical
enough web pages.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sure, Adobe would like there to be an international law applying to
every human being.  But that wish is a long way from an actual present
claim against Sklyarov, and such a claim reported in <EM>LG</EM> is the basis
of my original letter.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather]
I don't know whether to apply quite that level of slippery slope ... a
law to every human being ... to Adobe themselves.  But I don't feel any
qualms about applying it to the people who wrote and voted for the DMCA
itself.  I believe that what the DMCA supporters want is to be able to
sell and restrict every piece of data that might flow past them, until
they are more wealthy than the Ferengi clan who has the exclusive
concession on Q-tips(tm) cotton swabs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The present claim may be unfounded;
I personally believe it to be worse than that since I think Adobe is biting
the hand that would feed them Russian customers.  But I think the <EM>precedent</EM>
that speakers can be picked up and singled out for their corporate entities'
infractions, to be a quite terrifying one.  You see, I don't honestly
believe that someone has a plane-bomb with my photograph taped to its nose,
or that I am any more likely to be in a building that gets toasted by
terrorism, than I am to merely get run over by a car when walking to the
supermarket, or struck by lightning the next time I go hiking, or win the
local Lotto.  But I <EM>do</EM> expect to speak at events, and someday for those
events to be in other countries, who may have even weirder laws, be more
abitrary about making them, or have worse treatment of accused people.  If
I end up in a situation where such a country has half a case, I no longer
expect the US to be able to protect me much ... because they've already
burned us in that regard.  Alan Cox won't be at ALS -- because he's refusing
to travel here while this sort of nonsense is considered or even claimed to
be the law of our land.  This has been called the "chilling effect" in
literature that follows censorship cases.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm not a lawyer, I'm a frightened human being, and I wrote my own opinion.
If you don't like it, tough.  It's my free speech and our free press...
and I'd very much like to keep it that way. If that means speaking up for
the freedom <EM>to speak</EM> as well as the freedom to say particular things -
I'll do it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Actually, ElcomSoft hired a company located in the US to collect the
money.  I think the web site in question was that company's.  However,
the company also has offices, employees, etc. on US soil.  That's
not insignificant.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
It makes it even worse.  If EIcomSoft's US partner is the offender, it's
their top brass that should be standing in court.  If EIcomSoft themselves
are the offenders, it's their export agents who should be standing there --
but in no case the programmer, because the code's legal and even REQUIRED
elsewhere, and reverse engineering itself, by fair means but not foul, is
(for the moment at least) legal here.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There's also precedent that "Code is Speech, and to be protected as such."
As for whether sanity will prevail, only time will tell.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike] 
I guess we're just going around in circles now, and the thing to do is
wait until the case is presented and see what the lawyers say then...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
What we're really down to is the issue of what Sklyarov did vs what he
is accused of.  I don't even pretend to know the detailed facts of the
case, so I won't argue whether he distributed, trafficked, aided, or
abetted.  I don't know.  And you know what?  The FBI and US attorney
don't either.  It takes a trial to answer questions like that.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I just think when one says "was jailed for..." in this pre-sentence
context, one is talking about what the person's accused of, not what
he did.  I don't think Sklyarov is accused of writing a program.  But
I think there are people, including LG readers, who believe that the
FBI would also arrest a person who wrote a copyright-busting program
even if it never entered the US.  And that isn't true.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
'Tis a fact he wrote a program.  'Tis unknown if <EM>it</EM> entered here;
or if it did, that it did anything they can claim as directly damaging;
but probable that it was published in the proceedings of his conference.
I <EM>think</EM> that if he is accused of something they manage to make stick,
it will be quite a slippery slope, the top point being, he wrote the
program, because they know he won't wriggle out of that one.  As for what
the FBI would or would not do, I don't think am <EM>ad hominem</EM> argument on
their behalf is any more appropriate here than "I have kids and a wife,
can I go home now?" would be a good defense for Dmitry in court, and I don't
believe that you know what the FBI would or would not do, anyway.  I do
believe that you trust them with your rights, further than I trust them with
mine.

The damage has already been done.  I think it will take some very brave judges.

Hi,
</P>
<P>
I know this my be a little much, but seeing as how palmtops are so abundant
these days. I was thinking how great it would be ig Linux Gazzette newest
issue was available at the same web page monthly so it could be synched as
as Avantgo (www.avantgo.com) channel.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">There is a link <A HREF="../current"

<P>
Also, not trying to be
bothersome but if everything but the links to the articles was removed it
would better. But if that is too much could you please at least remove this
section from the bottom:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br> TWDT 1 (gzipped text file)
<br> TWDT 2 (HTML file)
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
are files containing the entire issue: one in text format, one in HTML. They
are provided strictly as a way to save the contents as one file for later
printing in the format of your choice; there is no guarantee of working
links in the HTML version.
It would remove about 1Mb from the size or my download when I download the
page everything 1 link deep (I only have 16 Mb RAM) also if you were to do
that it would make a good Avantgo channel if they will carry it and possibly
get some other readers. Thanks.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">We get many requests from readers to offer LG in different formats, make

everybody.  What we have is a compromise that has evolved over the

make a correction I have to change the same thing in three files--but
there is so much reader demand for them that we cannot drop them.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Perhaps you can arrange with a mirror to offer a customized version of
LG optimized for palmtop reading.  The mirror could make a script that
downloads the files and removes the TWDT versions, or replaces them with
small files that explain that the larger files are available only on
normal mirrors.

<P>
Some of the mirrors seem not to be functioning.

<P>
I just thought it would be nice to be able to keep up a little
better (information overload you know).
</P>

Yes I forgot avantgo is commercial.
It is free to use personally, but they charge for providing content (I
think). They used to allow users to share custom channels but not currently.
Plus they support mainly WindowsCE.

articles in the current issue?

<A HREF="../lg.rss">http://www.linuxgazette.net/lg.rss</A>.
This was originally created at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxfocus.org/">Linux Focus'</A> request so we can
share current article links.  (We put LF's links in
<A HREF="lg_bytes72.html#links">News Bytes</A>.)  Any site may parse this
file and use it to generate links to the current LG articles on their
web page.

Are there any linux apps that keep you up to date on html content (ie
channel subscriptions).
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">There are programs that moniter a list of webpages and let you know whether
any have changed.  I haven't used any of them.  Look in your distribution.
You can also write a program in Python to do this, using the urllib
module.

You mean like plucker (<A HREF="http://plkr.org"
	>http://plkr.org</A>) ?

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I think you'll want to take a look at Sitescooper (<A HREF="http://www.sitescooper.org"
	>http://www.sitescooper.org</A>)
- while it's rather Palm specific, I think it uses Plucker under the hood.
Of course it's source available and already knows a whole bunch of PDA formats
so it can almost certainly be tweaked to other handhelds and PDA-doc formats.
<EM>Linux Gazette</EM> is there already, item 135 in their list last I looked

One last thought on the original matter, if the html file TWDT 2 (HTML file)
provided at the bottom of the page was named
<A HREF="../current/current.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/current/current.html</A> that would work also.

<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="$000066">Starting with this issue, I have made
<STRONG>TWDT.html</STRONG> a symlink to <STRONG>issue##.html</STRONG>.
Give yourself a bookmark of

Wed Oct 31 23:24:13 PST 2001
<BR>Mike Orr (<a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net?subject=Mirrors%20page%20renovations">LG Editor</a>)

<P> The LG <A HREF="../mirrors.html">mirrors page</A> has been revamped.
25 new sites have been added, and the HTML has
been regularized.  All the entries are now in a database, making Your Editor's
task easier.

<P> This project originally started in February, with me cutting-and-pasting
the data into a text file in mail-header format.  This was taking forever, so I
got Dan Wilder to write me an awk script.  This saved 90% of the typing,
although I still had to make lots of manual changes due to the irregularities
in the original HTML document (created many moons ago, and added to over time).
I wrote a small Python program to load the mail-header file into MySQL, then
used mysqldump/mysql to make further changes.  

<P> The HTML is generated by a Python script and a Cheetah 
(<A HREF="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/</A>)
template.  

<P> I plan to write an article about all this, but first I want to write a
routine to verify the links and delete the ones that are persistently down.  In
the meantime, the program listing and template are on my web site <A
HREF="http://iron.cx/cheetah/lgmirrors/">http://iron.cx/cheetah/index.html#lgmirrors</A>
(temporary link).

<P> Thanks to all the mirrors for their patience, especially those like
<A HREF="http://www.gazette.linux.ru.net/">http://www.gazette.linux.ru.net/</A>
(Russian translation),
<A HREF="http://linux.osso.org.co/">http://linux.osso.org.co/</A>,
etc. that submitted their links several times during the transition.

<P> All mirrors, please check your entry and let me know if it's incorrect.
