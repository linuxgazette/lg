<FONT COLOR="green">Alan Cox Censors Kernel Changelog In Response To DMCA
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> In Linux 2.2.20-pre10's 
<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100374609914587&w=2">
changelog</a>, Alan Cox refuses to list the
details for some "security fixes", writing, "Details censored in
accordance with the US DMCA". Apparently file ownership and permissions
might be used to protect a copyright, and highlighting the fixes in a
changelog could thus be seen as publishing information on copyright
circumvention. There was a thread of discussion leading from this decision
on linux-kernel, with some list-members feeling that Alan was
overreacting. Others made the very fair point that it was up to Alan
whether or not he wanted to take the risk of potentially violating the
DMCA. Alan's position is that he has taken legal advice, and that this is
the most prudent course of action. 
<p>
LWN's  
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1025/">
coverage</a> of this story highlighted the fact that although the
changelog is censored, the actual code and patches are not. 
This was also noted on linux-kernel.
Rik van Riel posted a link (on Slashdot and linux-kernel) to
<a href="http://thefreeworld.net/">
http://thefreeworld.net/</a> where you can get the changelog, along with
other information/tools not allowed in the US (this is for non-US visitors).
Further comments can be

<FONT COLOR="green">An Irish Perspective
</FONT>
</H3> 
With the current confusion and controversy regarding US law relating to
software and technology (<A HREF="../issue71/lg_bytes71.html#leg">reported last month</A>
in News Bytes),
 it might be of interest to take a glance at how
these issues play out elsewhere, such as Ireland.
The IT sector has been a big contributor to
Ireland's recent economic 
<a href="http://www.irlgov.ie/finance/publications/meb/mebjun00.htm">
upturn</a>.
However, there have been relatively few policy developments in the area.
One of the more significant government initiatives has been the 
<a href="http://www.entemp.ie/ecd/ecommact.pdf">
Electronic Commerce Act(2000)</a>(PDF). A more readable
<a href="http://www.gov.ie/tec/communications/technology/electronicenvironment.htm">
commentary</a>
on the act is available. One important, and encouraging, inclusion is the
recognition of the right to strong cryptography. As is  pointed out in the
commentary, 
<blockquote>
"...the Act provides for a court order to be issued requiring a person to
disclose the encrypted evidence in a plain-text form.  However, section 27
of the Act specifically provides that nothing in the Act shall have the
effect of requiring the disclosure of unique data such as codes, passwords,
algorithms, private cryptographic keys..."  
</blockquote>
There is also a rejection of the concept of
key escrow, which is reiterated in the Government
<a href="http://www.gov.ie/tec/communications/ecommerce/signat.htm">
Policy on Cryptography and Electronic Signatures</a>, which also asserts
the right to free choice of cryptographic method. Partly, these policies
were adopted because they were seen as pro-business: technology companies
are more important to the Irish economy than media companies.
Another factor that may have influenced this decision is the fact that
Ireland's communications are vulnerable to monitoring by other
states for conventional or industrial espionage. Such allegations were 
<a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/sr/sr.pages/sr4.what/sr4.scr4.htm">
made</a> 
<a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0715/tapping.html">
against</a>
the UK regarding Capenhurst Tower. On a European wide
level, similar concerns have been
<a href="http://cryptome.org/echelon-ep.htm">
raised</a> regarding UK and USA involvement in Echelon.
<p>
The UK has taken a less liberal approach, in particular in the
<a href="http://www.fipr.org/rip/">
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act</a>. The Irish Government was keen
to follow a different route, in the 
<a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/finance/2000/0324/tech1.htm">
hope</a> that this would encourage inward investment in the electronic
commerce and software sectors. The
<a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/ireland/1998/0905/clinton14.htm">
electronic signing</a> 
by Bill Clinton and Bertie Ahern of a communique on
electronic commerce in September 1998 was a high profile publicity stunt to
reinforce this image. 
This, and other pro-business policies, were successful, 
<a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/connect-profiles.asp?sectorid=19">
moving</a> Ireland
to the position of second largest exporter of software in the world.
<p>
Another significant influence on
Irish policy is the 
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/">
European Union</a>. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as some good
policies have come from the EU. The 
<a href="http://cryptome.org/echelon-ep.htm">
Echelon document</a> mentioned earlier states
"...e-mails can and should be encrypted by everyone", and is a valuable
wake-up call to the importance of security.
Bruce Schneier has 
<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0108.html#8">lauded</a> the
EU for taking on board security professionals
<a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/spaf/coe/TREATY_LETTER.html">
concerns</a> regarding the new EU Cybercrime Treaty. Additionally,
the European Patent office
<a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/ap_gd/english/b-i-e.htm">
does not</a> grant software patents. A much more disturbing development is
the
<a href="http://cryptome.org/eu-copyright.htm">
The EU Copyright Directive</a>.
Like the DMCA, this is inspired by the 
World Intellectual Property Organization, and it has some 
<a href="http://www.eurorights.org/eudmca/index.html">
similar provisions</a>.
However, European directives are guidelines for national laws,
and certainly do not override national constitutions, so there should be a
longer road before the EU is fully subject to DMCA style rigour.
<p>
On the broader theme of civil liberties and misuse of power, there are
valuable lessons to be learned from Ireland's experiences.  Ireland's
troubled political history has in the past led to some very 
<a href="http://www.iccl.ie/criminalj/emergency/reports.html">
harsh laws</a> such as the anti-terrorist <em>Offences Against the State
Act</em>, repeatedly condemned by Amnesty International.  Also, there was
significant abuse of 'phone tapping, with both
<a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/ireland/2001/1017/hom11.htm">
journalists</a>
and
<a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/ireland/2001/0508/hom17.htm">
politicians</a> the victims.  
Phone tapping has valid security uses, as might some of the measures
which has just been enacted enacted in the United States, but it is very easy
to misuse.  Although the current Taoiseach (Prime Minister) has apologised
for the abuse, much harm has already been done. Indeed this controversy has 
<a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/breaking/2001/0927/breaking39.htm">
flared up again</a>, 
as one of the ex-ministers responsible for the wiretaps (and opposed to
apologies) is now chairing a government telecoms enquiry.

<a href="http://www.aclu.org/">
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</a> have prepared a
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/congress/patriot_chart.html">
chart</a> 
showing the differences wiretapping/surveillance provisions
between current law and various Anti Terrorism bills: The originally
proposed Bush Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), the House Judiciary compromise
Patriot Act, the Senat-Passed USA Act, and the House Passed USA Act. There
are also ACLU comments on each.
<p>
At Security Focus, Richard Forno has 
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/25">
written</a>
on these issues, and on the danger of too-readily sacrificing freedoms.
Richard Stallman has also 
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/10/22/1417238">
commented</a>
on the dangers of erosion of civil
liberties, in particular under the USA Act.
<p>
On Wednesday 24th October, the USA Patriot Act (HR 3162) was 
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/news/2001/n102401a.html">

<FONT COLOR="green">James Love on Lobbying and Hague Conventions
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> 
<a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> had a recent
<a href="http://slashdot.org/interviews/01/10/09/1014241.shtml">
interview</a> 
with consumer advocate James Love. He has some ideas on getting decision
makers' attention which may be of special interest to Linux advocates.  In
particular, he recommends writing to congressional staffers that are
working on the specific issue, rather than just to congress members.  Also,
he mentions that it is worth writing letters to well-read newspapers (or
local newspapers of a Congress member you want to reach).
<p>
This tactic could be surprisingly effective.  I know for a fact that in
government departments in my own country, Ireland, that civil servants are
assigned to read the major newspapers and cut out articles that are
relevant to their department. Particular attention is given to the letters
page, and these clippings are seen by the head civil servants and ministers
(i.e. decision/policy makers) in each department.
<p>
One other issue, raised by Love, which might be of particular relevance
here, is the 
<a href="http://www.hcch.net/e/workprog/jdgm.html">
Hague Convention on Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgements</a>. This is a
subject on which James has 
<a href="http://www.cptech.org/ecom/jurisdiction/hague.html">
commented</a> extensively.
The convention in question is a treaty that would implement, among
other things, cross-border patent enforcement.
"Everyone would be liable for infringement of foreign
patents, and the Hague Convention would give exclusive jurisdiction for
both validity and infringement in the county of registration." There is an
<a href="http://www.cptech.org/ecom/jurisdiction/whatyoushouldknow.html">
an online introduction</a> to this subject, by James Love. The official
website is at:

Wired's

allegation</a> 
that the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) tried (and failed) to get inserted
into the Anti-Terrorism bill a provision that would allow it to
hack into your computer to see if you had any unauthorized MP3s
and delete them.  It seems they think they had this right all along (!) but
are afraid they might get branded as Cyber-Terrorists if they tried it under the
new 
<a href="http://wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,47552,00.html">
USA-Act</a>! Of course, the biggest concern is collateral damage to
your computer, which RIAA wants to shirk responsibility for. This story
was also

<a href="http://arstechnica.com">ArsTechnica</a>. The RIAA later
published a 
<a href="http://www.riaa.org/PR_story.cfm?id=462">
rebuttal</a>, which doesn't really contradict much of what was written, but
spins differently.

<P> In a similar vein, though perhaps inaccurately, The Register 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/22087.html">
reported</a> 
on a secret meeting between Senators Fritz
Hollings, Ted Stevens, and representatives of RIAA and the big
media companies. Interesting reading, but now comes the caveat:
"Our source may not be all he or she claimed to be, and serious doubts have
been cast on the veracity of the comments attributed to the RIAA's Rosen
and co."

Slashdot ran a story on how

<a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> 
are pressing for 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/01/10/12/003242.shtml">

for any available and visible security measure. This was also covered by
The Mercury News
<a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/local/center/id101701.htm">
here</a>.
For a rational assessment of current security concerns take a look at Bruce
Schneier's 
<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram.html">
Crypto-Gram</a> special issue devoted to
<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0109a.html">
the September 11 terrorist attacks and their aftermath</a>. It is also an
excellent source of links. A fine point he makes is that many new
"security" measures are aimed at making people think they are more secure,
rather than actually improving real security. If you then throw into the
mix the interests of powerful lobbies opposed to free communication, you
get an unpleasant mix.

<FONT COLOR="green">W3C and Patents
</FONT>

<P> 
<a href="http://lwn.net/">
Linux Weekly News</a>  recently
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1004/">
reported</a> 
that
<a href="http://www.w3.org/">
W3C</a>
has a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-patent-policy-20010816/">
draft policy</a> which would allow patented technology to be
included in web standards. LWN has a good commentary on the issues, which
could ultimately endanger the future of free software on the internet.
The "Scalable Vector Graphics" (SVG) standard, already adopted by the W3C,
includes patented technology from Apple. The W3C is already behaving as if
the new policy were in force.  <P> What most disturbed many observers was
the under hand way in which the change was apparently being sneaked through.
The "consultation period" came to most peoples attention thanks largely to
LWN's Adam Warner who  posted
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1004/a/w3c-patents.php3">
this message</a>.
Following this comments in W3C's  
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-patentpolicy-comment/2001Oct/thread.html">
comment thread</a> 
turned sharply against the idea once it became generally known. 
Included are comments by Linux bigwigs. Many of the most important posts
are linked from LWN. 
Some predict that this could lead to a situation similar to the one
following the 
<A HREF="http://www.burnallgifs.org">
patent rows</A> surrounding GIF's, and the subsequent development of PNG's.
LWN suggests the possibility that in the future, the free software
community may have to form another web standards committee to compete
with W3C if W3C starts destroying the web with non-open technology
that threatens the web's universal viewability.

<P>Unhappy news, 
<a href="http://www.lwn.net/">
Linux Weekly News</a> is facing the 
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1011/">
budget shortfalls</a>
common to free web
news sites.  In particular, Tucows is 
no longer able to continue providing support.
As a result, Michael Hammel, LWN "On the Desktop" columnist (and former LG
"The Graphics Muse" columnist) is leaving LWN.  We wish Michael well.  

<P> More disturbing is LWN's prediction that, "Unless we can come up with a
way of paying salaries soon, LWN risks dropping off the net entirely."
There is a mailing list to discuss LWN's future at

Rafal Wojtczuk. Briefly,
There are two bugs present in Linux kernels 2.2.19 and below,  and 2.4.9
and below (2.4.10 may be vulnerable too).  The first vulnerability results
in <em>local</em> DoS (based on deeply nested symlinks. The second one,
involving ptrace, can be used to gain root privileges <em>locally</em> (in
case of default install of most popular distributions). Linux 2.0.x is not
vulnerable to the ptrace bug mentioned. Kernel patch is included at the end
of the mail and

Three separate stories pointing towards possibly more widespread adoption
of Linux in the near future. First, in what one might call the birthplace
of Linux (and certainly Linus!), The Register
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/22070.html">
reports</a>
That Finnish local government is leaning away from Windows and towards Linux.
The city of Turku, population around 200,000, has reacted to Microsoft's
latest licensing changes by kicking off a study of Linux alternatives.
<p>
Also in Europe, IDG.net have reported that
Germany's lower parliament (the Bundestag) is 
<a href="http://idg.net/ic_712902_1794_9-10000.html">
considering</a> switching
from Windows to Linux for its 5000 computers.  The main reasons
are for security, stability and (again) to save money in the face of MS's
new upgrade terms.  The parliamentary committee will decide late
this year or early next year which OS will replace its current
version of Windows NT.
<p>
Finally, Technews.com have run a 
<a href="http://www.technews.com/news/01/171244.html">
Thai story</a>:
that Thailand's government will back the idea of using free, Thai-language
'open source' software as a way of reducing spending and software piracy.
An official is quoted:
"To be independent from foreign software, the country needs to build a
knowledge base along with developing human resources and work based on
open source software."

high-calibre technical content at this conference provide an important
service to their membership and the general open source community.  
<P> "We recognize this may only be a temporary readjustment until the
'brick and mortar' companies start using open source products to a greater
degree.  Therefore, we feel that it is crucial to provide current technical
information to the community at this time," said Jon "maddog" Hall, USENIX
Director and ALS Invited Talks Program Chair. "There are also several
political issues facing the open source community right now such as DMCA,
SSSCA, copyrights, and software patents. The ALS invited talks track
reflects this and we felt that we could not put off these important
discussions to a later time."
