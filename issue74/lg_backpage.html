pyDDR 0.2.5<BR>
by theGREENzebra - Saturday, December 22nd 2001 00:39 EST 


  <P> About: PyDDR is a clone of DDR ("Dance Dance Revolution") written in 
  Python. The idea of DDR is simple. There's a mat with four 
  directional arrows, and the game scrolls arrows up the screen to the
  beat while playing a song. When the arrows reach the top of the screen 
  (not sooner and not later), the player hits the corresponding arrow on 
  the pad, and given that it's hit on time with the beat, points are scored. 
  Based on how well the dance is put together, s/he is graded at the end 
  of the song.

  <P> Changes: PyDDR now has working DDR mat support. STEP files can now 
  contain starting/ending markers to shorten a full-length MP3 into a 
  DDR-length song without modifying the file, and song and group names 
  are also displayed at the top of the playfield. A few bugfixes and 
  improvements were made regarding fonts, misses, and combos.
</PRE>

<P> This is a game written in Python 2.1 and using the Pygame package
 (which is a set of bindings between Python and the SDL game-development
 libraries).  

<P>  The thing that's wacky is that it's intended to be used with one of
 those DDR "dance mats."  These are little floor mats with four arrows
 arranged in a cross pattern (like old fashioned cursor keys before the
 advent of the "inverted T cursor/arrows" on PC keyboards).  You can
 "dance" on the mat, providing "step" input (timing and direction or
 foot placement) for the game.  It then awards points based on how 
 closely you follow the dance step (which it's displaying and scrolling
 to the tempo of some MPEG encoded music).

<P> You might have seen video games where kids where dance for a high 
 score.  I know that I saw lots of these in Japan, where it's apparently
 *very* popular.

<P> I suppose this is the most exciting non-violent, completely G-rated
 fun that's available for kids on the 'net.

<P> (Maybe the fact that *I* think it's "wacky" reveals too much about
 me!)

<STRONG>
Huibert Alblas asks:<BR>
Ext3 and ext2 are compatible filesystems, you can mount ext3 filesystems
with an "only ext2" kernel, _but_ it has to be cleanly unounted (damn,
what is the correct past tense for that what I want to express?)

"Has to have been cleanly unmounted." English can get very funky
sometimes... OTOH, Spanish isn't much better. Hey, Mike! Does Esperanto
suck just as much with tenses, or (being a designed language) did they
actually do something with this mess?

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Iron]

<P>
It would be the same in Esperanto.  (But see below.)

<P>
<EM>Ext2 kaj ext3 estas fajl-sistemoj kunlaborivaj.  Oni povas mauxnti
ext3-an fajlsistemon en koro "nur" ext2-a, *sed* gxi devas esti pure
malmauxntita.</EM>

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]

<P>
Hey, that looks like code I've been writing lately! :) I don't think I've
ever seen written Esperanto before, other than single words or so - my
memory says I have but can't provide written proof. This is cool.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Iron]

<P>
But it would be more natural to transform the sentance:
<PRE>
... *if* it has been cleanly unmounted == 
	oni povos ... *se* gxi estos pure malmauxntita.
	(-os : both clauses in future tense because of the "if")

... *only if* == *nur se*

... *if* one unmounted it cleanly first ==
	*se* oni jam malmauxntos gxin pure
	(literally: "already will mount")
</PRE>


There's no way around the fact that "has to be cleanly unmounted"
requires three verbs, with the last one being a past passive participle.
What Esperanto gives you is a complete set of active and passive
participles for all tenses.

<PRE>
mauxnti   = to mount (pronounced "mount-ee")
mauxntas  = I/you/we/they mount, (s)he mounts
mauxntis  = mounted
mauxntos  = will mount
mauxntu   = mount!  (imperative)
mauxntus  = would mount  (subjunctive, as in:
	If I had mounted ext3, my files wouldn't be ruined.
	Se mi mauxntus ext3'on, miaj fajloj ne estus ruinitaj.

	If I had been accustomed to mounting ext3, my files wouldn't be ruined.
	Se mi kutimus mauxnti ext3'on, miaj fajloj ne estus ruinitaj.
	(kutimi = to do something habitually)
</PRE>


<P> It's easier to explain the participles with "prezidi" (to preside):
<PRE>
prezidanto   = president  (he-who-is-presiding)
prezidinto   = former president   (he-who-was-presiding)
prezidonto   = president-elect    (he-who-will-preside)

prezidato    = subject   (he-who-is-presided-over)
prezidinto   = former subject   (he-who-was-presided-over)
prezidonto   = future subject   (he-who-will-be-presided-over)

Not officially a part of Esperanto, but you can get away with:

prezidunto   = (subjunctive: he-who-would-be-president [but he's not])
preziduto    = (subjunctive: he-who-would-be-presided-over [but he's not])


When you want to get away from tense:

prezidento   = President (no tense affiliation; a separate word root
                          ...but most verbs don't have an -ent counterpart)


gxi devas esti malmauntita == it must be unmounted (it must have been unmounted)

li devas esti malmauntinta gxin ==
	he must have unmounted it
	he was obligated to have unmounted it

li devus esti malmauxninta gxin ==
	he should have unmounted it   (subjunctive: but he didn't)


Unofficially, you can combine "esti malmauxntinta" into one verb: 
	malmauxntinti     (to have unmounted something)


Thus, 
	gxi devas malmauxntiti    (it must have been unmounted)
collapsing three verbs into two.

Or even:
	malmauxntintis    (is having unmounted something)

So these are equivalent:
	li estas malmauxntinta gxin
	li malmauxntintas gxin
	== he has unmounted it.

	li estis malmauxntinta gxin
	li malmauxntintis gxin
	== he had unmounted it.
</PRE>

But one normally tries to keep the verbs as simple as possible, and not
use participles unless necessary.  English and Spanish habitually say
"is doing", "was doing" when the participle isn't necessary: this is
*not* done in Esperanto.  Although if you do it, it's not "incorrect",
just weird.

<P> The unofficial forms aren't in the grammar books or used by the great
writers, so they aren't recommended for academic/professional use, but
because they are logical extensions of the grammar system, they aren't
"wrong" per se.  If enough people use them, eventually they will be
acknowledged in the Plena Vortaro (Complete Dictionary, literally
"full word-collection").

<P>

	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]

<P>
The implications behind all of that are fascinating, "great writers" and
"academic/professional use" particularly. Any estimates on how many
Esperanto speakers there are in the world?


<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Iron]

<P>
The only number I heard was that it's the same size as the smallest countries
in the United Nations.  I forget which those were.  I suppose we can say, a
bit smaller than Liechtenstein.  How big is Liechtenstein now?

<P> The difference is that Esperantists are scattered all over the world rather than
being concentrated in one country.  So for instance, you can take an around-the-world
trip and stay only at Esperanto-speaking lodgings using the Pasporta Servo 
("passport service", 
<A HREF="http://home.planet.nl/~lide/ps/ps_inf_en.htm">http://home.planet.nl/~lide/ps/ps_inf_en.htm</A>).  This gets
you the inside scoop on a country whose language you don't know, even if the
hosts don't understand your language.  

<P> "Great writers" was an exaggeration.  I meant the most respected Esperanto writers
and translators.  E-o's creator L L Zamenhof translated the Bible and Hamlet himself
before introducing the language, and wrote numerous original poems and proverbs.
(The regularities of the language make finding rhyming and metric pairs relatively
easy.)  

<P> "Famous" original works in Esperanto include _Metropoliteno_ by Vladimir Varankin,
written in the 1920s about the building of the Berlin and Moscow subways.  (The
author was either a loyal Soviet or submitted to Soviet censorship rules, so you
have to ignore the propaganda-speak in it.)  _Mr Tot Acxetas Mil Okulojn_ 
(Mr Tot Buys a Thousand Eyes), a humorous look at a travelling salesman with
comments about the invasion of privacy (Carnivore, PGP back doors, I *knew* we 
could tie this to Linux somehow!). _Kredu Min, Sinjorino!_ (Believe Me, Ma'am!).
etc.  Also the infamous _Knedu Min, Sinjorino!_ (Knead Me, Ma'am!), a dictionary of
"taboo and insulting expressions", whose title is a satire of the previous book.

<P> Most Esperanto books, however, are translations.  But whereas most
translations to English come from the top five big languages, translations to
Esperanto come from a wide variety of small languages.  Hungary and Bulgaria
were centers for Esperanto translation and academia during part of the 20th
century, and there was also significant activity in England and Germany before
WWII.  In the late 20th century, China produced a significant number of
children's books and translations of Chinese literature, due to government
sponsorship of Esperanto.  (The way the government is now sponsoring Linux
projects.)  Japan produces a science-fiction anthology series _Sferoj_
("spheres", but also a pun: "sferoj => science-fiction-pieces" analogous to
"negxeroj =&gt; snowflakes [units of snow]") containing sf from many countries,
sometimes translated, sometimes original.  Brazil, Finland and the Netherlands
have translators doing their own national works and also works from many other
countries.  There are also works that have been overlooked in English
translation; e.g., _Lirikaj Perloj de Al-Andalus_ (Lyric Pearls of
Al-Andalus_), "Spanish and Jewish lyric poetry from Spain during the Golden Age
of Islam".  And of course, the Koran is available, as well as Kempis'
_Imitation of Christ_, Confucian and Buddhist text and apologies, Spinoza,
Hillel, Descartes, etc.

It comes down to being a responsible OS.  Linux has gained lots of brownie
points by being the OS that's compatible with more systems than any other,
access a wider variety of filesystems and network protocols, has a less
buggy compiler and more sysadmin/developer support tools, etc.  In essence,
the one that saves the day for sysadmins/developers trying to work around 
the shortcomings in other systems.  Do we want to lose this good PR by not
recognizing that uninstalling Linux is just as legitimate as installing it,
and people may have good reasons to?  Perhaps they're a newbie trying Linux
out and got lost.  Perhaps they inherited a computer with Linux on it.
Whatever.  It's about making Linux into a system that "plays nice with others".
Or more correctly, enhancing the already-good job Linux does with this.
It's about being a responsible OS.  

<P> Now think about what help The Borg gives you if you want to uninstall it to
install Linux.  Is there any documentation in the Windoze manuals for this?
What about documentation on how to set up Windoze so that it can share the
system with Linux?  Of course not.  Nobody in their right mind would want to
uninstall The Borg.  It has all the features consumers are demanding, and it's
"innovative".  After all, The Borg had Plug-n-Play first!  

<P> Thus, it's a feather in Linux's cap to make sure the "uninstalling Linux"
entry is prominently displayed near the top of the FAQ.  It shows that we're
confident enough in the OS to help you uninstall it if you want to.  (You'll
be back...)  It gives newbies a safety valve in case they need to uninstall
Linux someday, they'll know where to look.  And finally again, it's a feature
Windows *doesn't* have.

<P>
Uninstalling Linux works out to pretty much the same thing as uninstalling
Wind*ws - and Microsoft does indeed have an entry in their Knowledge Base
that describes how to do that (I found the link at Dell, while searching
for serial port loopback info. <shrug> Go figure.) In reality, we're
providing instruction for either one. Hmm, <EM>there's</EM> a different way of
looking at it...

<P>
I definitely agree with the above logic if not the fine details.

points!!!, so they must!!! be very!!! important!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank
you!!!!!! for letting us know!!!!!!!!!!!

<H3>Later...</H3>

Wow, that's really exciting. Is there a reason that you're telling us about
this? I'm sure that if you wanted help, you would have provided a list of
exactly which errors you got (preferably by copying and pasting rather than
retyping), in which kernel version, which module(s), etc. As it is, - well,
my neigbor's favorite goldfish died a month ago, so I'm fresh out of
sympathy. &lt;shrug&gt; I guess that you *are* the only one with this problem...
at least you're the only one who _knows_ about any part of this that's a
problem. The rest of us are completely in the dark, due to lack of
information.

5. No FTP
                 I connect to the web thru a LAN! It works!!! 
</STRONG>

Wow. More excitement. Now, if we only knew which particular "it" that
refers to... Web connection? FTP? Pouring milk into your breakfast cereal
without spilling any? Tune in for our next exciting episode, when our
mysterious guest reveals all!
