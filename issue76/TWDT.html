<P>
I am writing reguarding the Alcatel Speed Touch USB modem, under Linux,
particularly Mandrake Linux 8.1.
</P>
<P>
I have been trying to get this modem to work for about a month now.  It
seems I almost have it, at least compared to where I was a couple of
weeks ago.  I have been following the HowTo's, I've found on the
internet.  They seem to differ slightly from web page to web page, but I
believe I finally got the kernel and the drivers set up to work, but I
think I might have some setting messed up somewhere, or maybe a module
not loaded or something.  I was hoping you might be able to help me find
where I'm having a problem.  The message I get when I try to connect
with br2684ctl -b -c 0 -a 0.0.35 is something like
</P>

<blockquote><pre>RFC1483/2684 bridge : Created nas0 interface
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(something like that)
</P>

<blockquote><pre>RFC1483/2684 bridge : Connecting to ATM 0.0.35 Encapsulation LLC
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(again it says something like this)
</P>

<blockquote><pre>RFC1483/2684 bridge : fatal : failed to connect on socket
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(here's the error message I get exactly as given to me)
</P>
<P>
Is there anything you might be able to tell me from the informatoin
given, what I should be looking at to correct my problem?  If you need
anymore info please let me know what it is and I will get it right to
you.
</P>
<P>
Thanks
<br>Tom

<P>
There's a program in <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> unstable called xt (xtraceroute).
It's supposed to plot the traceroute path on a picture of the
earth.  However, it doesn't seem to have enough location
coordinates in its database to do anything.  Has anybody used
this program?  Did you have to enter your own coordinates for
all the hosts you traceroute from and to?

Hi guys,
I don't know how much this will matter to the non-Europeans in the audience,
but how am I going to get the Euro symbol to appear in my favourite
applications? I have just installed <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 7.2 on my laptop, and would like
to indicate my preferred currency symbol in a spreadsheet or word processor
document. The only mention I can find in previous issues of LG (wonderful
publication - keep up the great work!), apart from a <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> Euro-HOWTO, is
the usual "just my .02 Euro". Does anyone have any ideas?
</P>
<P>
Regards,
<br>Donal.

Hi,
</P>
<P>
I've read where DHCP can return a fixed IP for specified MAC hardware
addresses.  My question is can DHCP be limited to return either fixed or
dynamic IP to only a list of MAC hardware addresses?  This would be a
security enhancement as only specified machines could get access to the
server?

<P>
Hi Gang!
Some time ago a friend of mine took me to a guy that - via some
strange ways - had gotten hold of some convex computers (2
refrigerator-sized boxes). They were struggeling to get them to boot
again (I think they called the OS spp-ux os something similar) and
maybe in the end getting them to boot linux (hey, not totally OT). So,
short question: does somebody of you know these beasts? If yes, I can
figure out more about'em, otherwise forget them (saw something like a
VAXbar some time ago, maybe that'll be their new purpose real soon

<P>
I am running RedHat 7.2 and using ext3 file system with software raid,
using 2 20gig drives.  The raid drive(s) are my boot drive.  The 2
drives are identical and are used something like this <TT>/dev/hda1</TT> = ext3,
<TT>/dev/hdb1</TT> = ext3.  I made everything between the 2 drives the same.  The
mirrored drive is <TT>/dev/hda1</TT> and <TT>/dev/hda2</TT> = <TT>/dev/md0.</TT>  The system has
been running very well.
</P>
<P>
I recently did a kernel upgrade.  The upgrade went ok and will boot and
run from a floppy drive with no problems.  But if I attempt to boot from
the hard drive(s) drive it will only boot the old kernel.  I have
updated the grub.conf and have even attempted to enter the commands for
booting from the command line.  The grub menu never shows the commands
entered into the grub.conf file and I receive a error "Can't find files"
if I attempt to enter the command line.
</P>
<P>
I have attempted to find what I need to change/fix but have not found
the information needed to update grub while booting from a raid/ext3
file system.
</P>
<P>
Anyone have any ideas?
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
<br>Joseph St.Clair

<P>
Hi Gang,
</P>
<P>
I recently upgraded from RedHat 6.2 to 7.2. Since then I have
experienced a number of incidents where the system simply froze up
solid. It would not respond to keyboard input or mouse clicks. Screen
was not being updated at all. The only way out was the Reset button.
This sounds similar to the problems reported by N.P.Strickland
(<A HREF="../issue74/tag/9.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue74/tag/9.html</A>), but I can relate my
incidents to some things which infer that the solutions suggested to
that post will not resolve my situation.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, this has only started happening since I upgraded. I never
experienced anything similar on RH 6.2 (or 5.2 fot that matter). The
hardware is unchanged, so I believe it must be caused by software, not
hardware.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, I am pretty confident that it is related somehow to sound. I
can bring on a freeze by running a number of multimedia programs (e.g.
XMMS, gtv). They appear to work fine for, say, 30 seconds, then Zap! the
system freezes up solid.
</P>
<P>
Can anyone shed any more light?
</P>
<P>
Thanks
<br>Ian Callahan

<P>
Ben,
</P>
<P>
Since I'm a relative linux newbie and software installation has been
learning process, I appreciatee your article on installing from source.
One question though.  After downloading and uncompressing the source,
installation seems to be pretty much a three step process.
</P>
<Pre>
./configure
make
make install
</Pre>
<P>
My question is this: should I become root in this process and if so at
what stage?  I'm thinking that I should become root after "make." and
not before.
</P>
<P>
Anyway I appreciated the article especially the part about analyzing a
failed install.  It would have taken me a while to figure that out on my
own.
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
<br>Adam York

I always enjoy reading the Gazette offline (maybe even at the beach on my

Keep up the good work.

Look in The Answer Gang Knowledge Base:

especially under the sections "Linux Distributions", "Before you install Linux",
"Installing Linux", etc.  Also see the section "Linux tech support questions"
question "How can I get help on Linux?", which has a list of books and a link

Hi Gang!
Just had some time and took a look into the howto section at
linuxdoc.org and found the Tips-HOWTO.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Nice thingies in there, although the last editing seems to be ages
ago.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Soooo, since LG is already present in there and you have such
wonderful ideas, scripts and perl-thingies (Ben?), after you have
discussed them here in the list and optimized them one could post it
to the maintainer of the Tips-HOWTO for inclusion.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What do you think? Thats a place a newbie finds rather easier than
this mailing-list, don't you think?
Just a suggestion.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
CU Robos
</STRONG></P>
<P>
&lt;grin&gt; Good idea, Robos. Instead of the Tips-HOWTO, however, the areas
you're asking about are a subset of the LG Knowledge Base that
Chris Gianakopoulos and I have been working on for the past month plus;
see &lt;<A HREF="../kb-faq.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/kb-faq.html</A>;. Better yet, wait 
a week or
so and see the new version - Chris has been doing a sterling job of adding
the stuff from the previous issues of LG while I'm banging away on
modifying the overall KB-FAQ, TAG-FAQ, etc. The difference between the last
month and the one that's coming up is going to be a large one - there are
many, many more articles/issues incorporated into it than there were the
last time - and it's really turning into a great resource. -- Ben

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Linux Gazette is slow to adopt new visual technology, kind of like the Amish.
We prefer to wait a few years and see which technologies would actually be a
long-term benefit to all our users.  It's an unusual kind of zine; I don't know
of any others like it.  Most people read it from mirrors in 47 countries,
through the Linux Documentation Project, download the FTP files, read it on a
CD-ROM, download the articles to their palm pilot, etc.
So anything dynamic is out because it would cut off a significant portion of
the readership.  We also don't want to impose any special software requirements
on the mirrors.  Two concessions to dynamism: the search engine and talkbacks
on the main site.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">We're also mindful of bandwidth restraints: many readers and mirrors live in
countries where they pay by the minute for Internet access, so I try to keep
each issue down to less than a megabyte or two (compressed).
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">We also have to piece together the whole thing into an all-in-one version (the
entire issue on one page), because that's how LG started and many readers prefer
to print it that way.  This rules out differing stylesheets per article, or
anything special the article needs in the HTML header.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Most of the editors subscribe to the "good website design" philosophy, meaning
content is king.  If you can't say it in text, it isn't worth saying.  Obviously
we don't go all the way on that, because we have been publishing several cartoon
series.  But still, all decorations are evaluated in terms of how essential they
are to the content.  If readers like the text, they'll be back.  if they won't
read it unless it has bells and whistles all around it, well, we don't want them
anyway.  There are plenty of sites that are highly graphical (and can't be
navigated unless you have Flash and Javascript enabled), and LG doesn't wish to
compete in that department.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">By the way, Your Editor has a strong adversion to "left column" and
"right column" sidebars (tables), and will resist them as long as he can.
Let the article text flow freely across the entire width of the browser,
outside a table, and in the default font.  Persumably, the reader has
adjusted his default font to his preference.

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">A-men to that! And a-women, too. I don't long for uniformity on the Web,
but if more people paid attention to those basics, more information would
be more easily accessible. Sing that song!

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Not to rag too hard back, but:
<ol>
<li> Tell O'Reilly to get that wart zapped.  The last time I saw this
           was LWN having some problems with an ad provider whose "pull
           through" would bomb out that way about 1 time in 10.  I'm not
           sure if they fired the ad provider, or just made 'em fix it,
           but I know it's tricky to chase down problems that are hard to
           reproduce.
<li> We can't shoot at bugs without a target symbol over the varmint.

let me know as its homesite died ages ago and I haven't found packages since.
Maybe it was under a non-free license??

last version was April 1999.  It died because its sponsoring organization
(CNRI?) stopped putting developer resources into it.  They did that because
they realized its features and speed were never going to compete with recent
versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">With Grail died the ability to run Python applets in a browser, but that's OK
because there never were any Python applets except a few demos.  But now there's
Jython, which is an implementation of Python in Java, so you can do almost the
same thing.

<P>
Macromedia Flash, Javascript and fancy graphics would be possible since
they are self-contained (i.e., don't require particular software on the
web server).  However, they would have problems on non-major browsers,
and LG readers have a wide variety of browsers, and are more likely
than the general public to run experimental browsers on principle.
Also, some readers have older computers, and buying a new computer would
cost several months' salary.  Last year I got a letter from a reader in
Africa asking if there is an e-mail version of LG (there isn't),
because his school cannot afford to read it on the web.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Macromedia Shockwave isn't readable on Linux (unless something new has
happened that I don't know about).  Flash is ok but broken in some
contexts, unusable entirely in others, and we don't want the site unusable
to anyone.  There are so many versions of Javascript nee' ECMAscript I
stopped counting -- and Java is getting there.  People read us worldwide
including on PDAs and in libaries and coffee shops.  (ok, the coffee shops
probably can handle the cool stuff.  We've gotten lots of questions about
coffee shops running Linux.)  Also on "that slow old thing" and a cheap
dialup link while preparing the spiffy new box to run Linux. (Even though
they <EM>can</EM> render the graphics, maybe it's so bad they even turn off image
loading in the GUI.)  Etc.

When I move jobs next week, (and desktop machines! yay to the end of

transfer speeds for up to 20 Mac OSX clients running video editing
software - Utilising the network drives as a data bank, so clients can
log onto any machine to edit and be presented with up to 10GB of storage

The problem is <EM>sustained throughput</EM>.  TTBOMK, <EM>nothing</EM> is fast
enough at the network filer level at the moment to do anything much
faster than DV (3.5MB/s).  To beat that, you need, I think, to go to
NAS, or something similar: shared <EM>drives</EM>, rather than shared
filesystems.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps things have speeded up a bit... but be prepared to go to either
100Mbs Ether with dedicated adapters, or Gigabit shared... and
something more towards token than ether is not out of line.

Either that, or nasty buffering on the mount client.

<P><STRONG>
respected sir
<br>i have a problem with linux instalation on 20Gb or
more capacity disks,i had installed on p3,20gb hd,64
mb ram.i make 2 1Gb partition as linux native &amp; one
200 mb as swap the instalation goes on smoothly but at
the end it gives error that first partition not lies
in 1024 cylinders what i can do to solve this problem
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Actually we're several guys, and one or more gals.  If you
respect us, that's nice, but not essential.
</P>
<P>
Upgrade to current LILO.  Most new distributions should
contain a LILO able to overcome the 1024 cylinder limit,
and so a newer distribution might be the easiest way
to do it.
</P>
<P>
Or, re-partition the disk so that its first partition, about 16Mb,
is mounted at <TT>/boot</TT>, second partition is swap, and the third partition
containing the remainder of the disk is mounted as <TT>/</TT>, the root
partition.  The installation scripts on the distribution will
probably give you an opportunity to specify how you want
the hard drive partitioned, and that's where you do this.
</P>
<P>
Make sure your kernel boot image (usuall vmlinuz) is located
in <TT>/boot</TT>, and is referenced from <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> as such.
You may have to move things around and rerun lilo after
the installation stuff completes.
</P>
<P>
Let us know how you are doing.

File cache always seems to take as much as it can and we <EM>really</EM> would
prefer to keep it low.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote>
<P>
Big file cache is not necessarily A Bad Thing.  As long as it
unloads fast when demand grows.
</P>
<P>
I'd look to other problems first.
</P>
<ol>
<li> Are you running 2.4.17 or something older and buggier?  If not
2.4.17, upgrade now.

<li>
Are you running an AMD Duron or Athlon + AGP video?  If so,
you'll need a kernel boot parameter to cut cache page size,
there's an interference between the way the kernel handles
DMA and the way AMD handles AGP, leading to sporadic random
cache corruption.
<li>
 You're 700M into swap.  That's never a Good Idea.  Unless what's
swapped out is more or less permanently swapped out.  If so
why are you running it?  If possible, get another gig of
memory.  The slowest memory is much faster than the fastest
hard drive.
</ol>
</blockquote>

<P><STRONG>
Hello Dan...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks so much.  Yes, we're running an older kernel ... mostly, 2.4.6 ...
I'll fix that.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As far as the swap, originally, we had no swap, but because the file cache
is so "hungry", I threw in swap as a brute force means because processes
were dying from lack of memory...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As it is, we run a computational fluid dynamics code that periodically dies
with no more than "broken pipe" as the error diagnostic, which, if I had to
make a W.A.G., I would assume a process died.  Before, it was a LOT
worse... It was ugly when something like portmap would croak.  So, lacking
any coherent solution and having unhappy users, I threw some swap in and it
seemed to help with stability tremendously.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But most recently, with one user process running, allocating about 1.7G,
the system was apparently thrashing horribly... very unresponsive and with
a system load on the order of 10.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As far as the swap versus file cache, it would seem to be silly to have a
file cache that's so large that swap starts coming into play.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Bye,
<br>Matt

</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
asks the question "How do I get the volume label from a data CD", and then
the three guys go on to not provide a very good answer...
</P>
<P>
If you would like to add the following, it may be useful to other readers.
</P>
<P>
There are two problems in identifying CDs -- one is identifying a data CD,
the other is identifying an audio CD.  Mr. Bray is asking specifically
about data, but it's also possible to determine a fairly unique ID for
audio CDs as well.
</P>
<P>
Data CDs are easy -- a 32-byte string is written in the ISO at offset
32808.  Some systems have a program called "volname" (part of the eject
package), which can pull this data out.  Otherwise, "dd" can be used:
</P>
<P><CODE>
dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=1 skip=32808 count=32
</CODE></P>
<P>
This is the volume label specified via the "-V" argument to "mkisofs" when
creating the CD image.
</P>
<P>
For audio CDs, it's (unfortunately) not as easy.  The CD Digital Audio
standard does not include a location for storing CD or track identification
information.  The answer for this that I've heard is that they felt it was
too hard a problem to solve initially.
</P>
<P>
While it may seem easy to add a few strings on the CD, it becomes harder
when you have to deal with an international market -- how do you make it so
that Japanese tracks can be identified, for example.  Remember, this was
back in the &lt;gasp&gt; '80s, when Unicode wasn't common.
</P>
<P>
So, the way people go about identifying audio CDs is by generating a
signature.  This signature consists of information about the length of
tracks, number of tracks, and various other information.  You can then
condense this information down into a single value.
</P>
<P>
This value can then be used to submit and request more specific data about
a disc or track.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the LinuxDoc CDROM-HOWTO for the dd command to pull this data off
the CD.
</P>
<P>
Sean

Hi,
I've just read your informative article on installing
from source in this months Linux Gazette.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You mention that it would be good if make files has
and uninstall target and that most don't. Well, if you
have a look at Checkinstall
(<A HREF="http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall-en.html"
	>http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall-en.html</A>)
it allows you to uninstall programs built from source.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What it does is to replace the "make install" command
with checkinstall. It makes a note of which files were
installed and allows you to uninstall the program
using the package management tools on your machine (in
my case dpkg). It also creates a .deb (or .rpm) so you
can install it on another machine.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've played with it for a few days now and it is
extremely useful.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Regards
John
</STRONG></P>
<P>
John,
</P>
<P>
Thanks for that tip.  I'm a moderately long-time member of
The Answer Gang, and had not heard of checkinstall before.
I often build from source, and had until now resorted to
clumsy and time-consuming expedients to manage uninstalls.
</P>
<P>
"checkinstall" is just what we need here at SSC, host of
The Answer Gang's mailing list server and The Linux Gazette's
web site.

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">This is pretty much the reason that I forwarded this to TAG. I've had seven
or eight e-mails telling me me about "buildpkg", "rpm", etc.; under Debian,
I'm familiar with "alien" - but none of these deal with the real issue of
"remembering" what the "make" did. They just convert the tarball (which
often cannot be done due to layout, etc.) into RPMs or DEBs, etc. This tool
- although I have not yet had the time to check it out - sounds like a very
nice possibility, and I'm going to be looking into it.

<P>
Well thanks, Ben, for forwarding it.

It sounds like this tool does something like what I've been doing by hand.
After building a package, I often

<P>
(that's "CTRL-D", an EOT character, to log out of script)
then edit the resulting "typescript" file to build a roster of what
was installed, which I then save in an "ssc" subdirectory of the build
directory, against a day when I wish to know what was installed.

You're absolutely right about alien et al.  They work from a tarball,
.deb, .rpm, etc.

However, most stock GNU packages don't even build an install tarball.
They just install directly, leaving a cryptic trail of what they
installed in the output from the "make install".  Without analyzing
that output you don't even get a tarball to "alien".
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions.  <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>-modified source trees build the
.deb packages directly, which can then be installed.  <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>-modified
source trees build a tarball directly.  No doubt <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> et al has
something similar ... brainfade prevents me from saying at the moment ...
</P>
<P>
All too often I find I must go directly to the original release of
some package, rather than using the distribution's source, either
because the package is not available under the appropriate distribution,
or because the distribution's package doesn't do it for us.  Wrong
or broken version, etc etc etc.
</P>
<P>
If this checkinstall does what it looks like it might do, it solves
that problem of "what do you do if you've only the original source code".

I want to write a program that on getting some sort of
trigger will automatically connect to the internet by
dialling the ISP's telephone number. After it has
established connection it should store the IP address
assigned to it by the ISP in a file.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Two major hints that, together, should give you the solution:
</P>
<ol>
<li> Search the Net for "linux" and "dial-on-demand". The standard answer to
this used to be "Diald", but nowadays it's built into pppd, so reading the
man page may be an even better solution.

<li> Read "<TT>/etc/ppp/ip-up</TT>", paying special attention to "PPP_REMOTE".
</ol>
<P>
That's it. There's no deep science to it.

You can do the following.....
</P>
<ul>
<li> Assuming that you are using Lilo as your linux
loader, then at the prompt type:

<blockquote><pre>linux init=/bin/bash root=/dev/hdxx ro
</pre></blockquote>

where "<TT>/dev/hdaxx</TT>" is the device file which points to
the root of your Linux partition (i.e. mounted "<TT>/</TT>")
(or change "linux" to the name of the stanza within
"<TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT>" that will load Linux).

<br>
This will then put you into a single user mode, with
all the partitions mounted as read-only.

<br>
Then at the prompt, type:

<blockquote><pre>fsck -f /
</pre></blockquote>

and this should fix any errors on the drive.

<br>
Usually, any inode data is stored within the
"<TT>/Lost+Found</TT>" directory.
</ul>
<p>
If you need any help, let me (us) know.

I have a linux box (RH 7.1) set up to serve as mail and internet server for
my two other home computers.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It is set up to dial on demand. Therefore ifconfig shows ppp0 up and
running all the time (when it is working properly)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would like to be able to check the status of the modem without lifting
the telephone from it's cradle.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have checked into using the lock file which can be written by pppd but
this is not very reliable when if pppd goes down unexpectantly it does not
always clean up after itself.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I haven't done anything with "diald" in a couple of years, but doesn't it
use SLIP to do its dirty work (i.e., the PPP link you request is actually
to a local VT; "diald" feeds your PPP daemon lots of baloney and sweet talk
while it actually makes the connection behind its back)? If so, then you
could always check if the 'sl0' interface is up without tripping off the
dial-up.
-- Ben
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The querent doesn't specifically mention 'diald', which does use the slip
interface as part of its mechanism.  The newer versions of pppd also
support dial on demand, and uses a different type of mechanism.
Unfortunately, I can't be too specific, as I've never set it up.  I would
guess that you could simply check to see if ppp0 (assuming only one
dial-up connection active at a time) is up, much the same way as was
suggested for diald.  Actually IIRC, in the case of diald, (which AFAIK,
is no longer actively supported) the slip interface goes away when the ppp
link gets established; so simply checking for a ppp interface would work
for diald as well.

Hi Gang!
Maybe I already told you about my little program to copy dvd's to
harddisk, called vobcopy (look on freshmeat). In the next release I
want to incorporate large file support (lfs - no, not linux from
scratch 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">. I found Jim Dennis' answer in the 67 issue and read
around various places (info libc, the suse-page, the large file summit
papers) but I am still unable to <EM>detect</EM> if the usersystem has support
for large files. We (another person joined me and did most of the lfs
stuff) found out about the -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE
-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE (the last one being redundant if not even close
to being wrong in my opinion) and off_t. But we are not sure if this
works correctly on both systems (supporting/not supporting). I would
think its better to know if the users system has support or not and compile
accordingly.
My approach would be somthing along the lines of look whats defined in
&lt;linux/*file.h&gt; and what the file system is the file gets written
to. But kinda ugly and probably wrong. Does one of you happen to know
how to figure it out?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Check for the presence of "ftello64" (declared in &lt;stdio.h&gt
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">. From "info
libc -&gt; I/O on streams -&gt; File Positioning":
</P>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<P>
- Function: off64_t ftello64 (FILE *STREAM)
</P>
<P>
This function is similar to `ftello' with the only difference that
the return value is of type `off64_t'.  This also requires that the
stream STREAM was opened using either `fopen64', `freopen64', or
`tmpfile64' since otherwise the underlying file operations to
position the file pointer beyond the 2^31 bytes limit might fail.
</P>
<P>
If the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name `ftello'
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
</P><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
"ftello" is the 'fixed' version of "ftell", but can be found on systems
with or without LFS. From the above, it looks like "ftello64" would only
exist on systems with LFS, where "ftello" would be an alias for it. I've
got to hand it to the GNU folks: cute trick.

this related with redhat linux
</P>
<ol>
<li> if you have free space in your harddisk for windows 2000 partition
then

<ul>
<li>first install win2000 on your system after installation
<li>
boot your pc with redhat linux7.2 cdrom and type on prompt "linux rescue"
enter
<li>
check on which partition no. windows 2000 install you can check this by
typing
<blockquote><pre>fdisk /dev/hda
</pre></blockquote>
press enter
<br>
then type "p " press enter
<br>
now you know your windows partition no.
<li>
mount the partition by typing

<blockquote><pre>mount -t vfat /dev/hda(windows partition no.)  /hdd
</pre></blockquote>

press enter

<br>
it will mount your windows partition at <TT>/hdd</TT> directory

<li>
as you installed linux first so your linux partition must be hda1 or
check your linux partition

<br>
run command

<blockquote><pre>dd if=/dev/hda(linux partition no.) of=/hdd/bootlin bs=512 count=1
</pre></blockquote>

press enter

<br>this command show you the message

<blockquote><pre>1 record in
1 record out
</pre></blockquote>
<li>
now type "exit" press enter

<li>
now edit the boot.ini in windows partition

<br>
add one line under the heading Oprating system
</P>

<blockquote><pre>c:\bootlin=3D"Redhat Linux "
</pre></blockquote>

save it and you are done

<li>
reboot the system
</ul>

<li>
if there is no free space
<br>
use partition magic to make some free space for windows 2000 and use the
same steps

</ol>

I've just installed RH 7.2 on a sony vaio, and was quite surprised by the

however, the user I created can not create, delete, copy, etc, files in
ROOT, or USR, or even HOME.

I am assuming I have to login as ROOT and join

<P>
You're missing something. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  In Linux (and unix in general) users
<em>don't</em> have the right to willy-nilly create files and run any old
program.  Would you like it if user jane had the rights to delete files
in you home directory?  Of course not!
</P>
<P>
Linux has rather strict rules about what you, a normal user can do.  The
root user, OTOH, can do <EM>anything</EM>.  This is a very dangerous thing if
you're not careful.  Let's say you wanted to delete all the files in
your home directory (you're allowed to do that, they're <EM>your</EM> files).
That would be done with the command
</P>
<P><CODE>
rm -rf /home/steve
</CODE></P>
<P>
If you accidentally typed it as
</P>
<P><CODE>
rm -rf / home/steve
</CODE></P>
<P>
You would get some error about not having permissions, etc.  And
depending where you were in the directory, ypou might or might not wipe
out your home directory.
</P>
<P>
However, if you were logged in as root and type the accidental line, you
would, literally, wipe out every file on the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
You might want to add the normal user to various groups, but you should
proabbly read up on Linux and permissions and all that.  Start by reading
the Dos/Windows User to Linux User HOWTO
( <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/DOS-Win-to-Linux-HOWTO-4.html"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/DOS-Win-to-Linux-HOWTO-4.html</A> ) to get
an idea on what's going on.
</P>
<P>
Reading the HOWTOs in general is a good idea (maybe not all at once,
mind you).  You can find all of them and more at www.linuxdoc.org

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

<P>
You mention that you are having problems w/your epson printer.
</P>
<P>
I'm not too familiar w/printer defs in things like ghostscript or gimp, but my
printing w/an hp 970 improved by orders of magnitude for all applications when I
installed turbo print. Colors come out good, speed is improved. Just works nice.

<P>
Today, the curiosity bug bit me again, so I poked my nose into the Linux
Visor USB mailing list, and - lo and behold - there it was. Seems that the
new version of "coldsync", at least the beta, now handles the m125! I
downloaded it, configured it, compiled it, made a config file - and...
ta-daa! Palm USB synchronization, under Linux.

<br>asked by Subroto Sengupta 
</P>

<P><STRONG>
Hello Sir,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would like to know how to set up a Linux 7.1 server and configure it 
properly to be able to telnet into it from a Windows client machine.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
A reply would be greatly appreciated.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sincerely,
<br>Subroto.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, that's a whole lot of questions.
</P>
<P>
There's no "Linux 7.1".  The Linux kernel's current versions
are 2.5.2 (pretty wild), 2.4.17 (conditionally stable), and
2.2.20 (quite stable).  (labels mine).
</P>
<P>
Linux is distributed by several vendors, who label their own
distribution with a version number.  You may be thinking about
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux 7.1.  Don't.  Get Red Hat Linux 7.2 or 6.2.
Other vendors (<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, Mandrake, <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>, <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>, <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>,
to name just a few) each use their own numbering schemes,
which have not much to do with those of the others.
</P>
<P>
How to set up a server?  Best advice I can give is "follow
the vendor's directions, and ask questions here when you
get lost".
</P>
<P>
Telnet?  Only on a protected network, I hope!  Telnet exchanges
a password in the clear, OK if just your immediate family is
watching the 'net, not so good if the password traverses six ISPs
and a few chunks of the backbone.
</P>
<P>
That said, during install, select the telnet package.  Sometimes
that's part of some other package, sometimes not.  Consult the
vendor documentation and help.
</P>
<P>
On exposed networks, use the ssh (secure shell) package on Linux,
and get "putty" secure shell client for Windows.  It's much
better than windows telnet, and it'll even telnet, if you must.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html"
	>http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</A>
</P>
<P>
or search google.com for "putty.exe".

You can keep your fortune file indexed and up-to-date on multiple

fortune-related tasks:
</P>

<blockquote><pre># List all the fortune files you maintain here.  (I just have them
# all in one big file)
FORTUNES = dmarti

# For every fortune file, the datfile is the same name but with .dat
# on the end
DATFILES = $(FORTUNES:=.dat)

# Make a copy of the fortunes file to the zork.net  collection
# (http://zork.net/fortunes/)  Since it's the first target, this
# target and its dependencies will run if you just type "make"
tozork : $(DATFILES)
        scp $(FORTUNES) $(DATFILES) zork.net:/usr/local/etc/fortunes
        touch tozork

# This target makes each .dat file from the appropriate fortune
# file, if it has changed.
%.dat : %
        strfile $&lt;

# Get rid of all the .dat files (not really needed, but it's traditional
# to have "make clean" do _something_)
clean :
        rm -f $(DATFILES)

# There is no file named "clean", but always build this target.
.PHONY : clean
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
For more information, see "man strfile" and "info make". Now that you know
how to manage fortunes by editing only one file and typing make, why
not put your favorite sayings on your web site as a fortune file
others can also use? (The old fortunes that come with most
distributions have come up way too often for us.)

"locate" is a wonderful command for quickly finding files on your system.

<p>Hey everybody and welcome once more to The Answer Gang.  It's gotten a 
little crowded in our little weekender pub here -- one querent offered
us some cake though, and I'm sure we'll enjoy it...
</p><p>
The statistics:  We now have 60 members in The Gang.  Less than 10
people received no answer whatsoever (and this can be attributed to things
like no subject, or no clear problem description).  Spam is down immensely
since Dan went and made some of the dead trout into a Rube Goldberg machine,
reducing the mails that flew by me to somewhere around 500.
</p><p>
The dumb thing of the month:  Some mailers not only turn stuff into HTML, but
they smush all the spaces out of it themselves, and then put the results in
quoted-printable.  Glork.  Much to my amazement that person got some answers
though I can't tell if they helped him.  But it certainly didn't get pubbed;
I couldn't read it to tell if it was juicy...
</p><p>
But the real Rant Of The Month has to go to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">The
GNU Project</a> for making it sexy to stop shipping man pages !?!   Sadly this
isn't news.  But definitely sadly, there are so many different places around
that helpful data <em>might</em> be ... and probably isn't, since many packages
pick one and don't have the others ... that we're gonna need a "<tt>wtfm</tt>" 
command.  An rtfm command that <em>works</em> would have to depend on it.
</p><p>
That stands for "Where's The Friendly Manual?"
</p><p>
Particularly egregious since distros now have to figure out their own way to
cook up replacesments, so when some cheerful soul pipes in "Oh just check the
man pages" ... the user can actually find one ... sigh ...  Debian has a 
standard undocumented.7 man page, which can be summarized:
</p><blockquote>
	Yes, we know there's no man page.  It's already been filed as 
	a bug, thus you see this.  If you'd like to write one for this 
	app and submit it we sure would appreciate it.
</blockquote><p>
Don't even get me <em>started</em> about distros that tell you that you can't
get any help at all unless your webserver is working.
</p><p>
Phooey!  I'm not going to let it ruin my weekend.  I'm going to a filk
conference, as I do a couple of times a year.  This particular one is 
<a href="http://www.consonance.org/">Consonance</a> in the Silicon Valley
area.  There will be bunches of computer songs there and I plan to be up 
late singing a few of them.  Regular readers already know about my 
<a href="../issue67/misc/tag/filksong-programmers-daughter.txt"
	>autobiographical filk song</a> but I've written one about my
laptop, and a couple about Linux'ing, too.  I'm not the really prolific
one though.  My friend Steve Savitsky has enough to fill at least a couple
of CDs... and heck, that's just his computer songs

I've been filtering more agressively.  This month's spam
bouncing features a 450 to "From: " addresses with domains
the MTA can't find in the DNS.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Since lots of spammers use unrepliable "From:" this knocks
those guys off.   We use a 450 instead of a 550 because
a 450 is retryable.  If it's just a DNS glitch, the retry
goes through.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So the real slimebags use a nonexistant user at a host that
exists but for some reason does not accept SMTP connections.
That way they pass the "does this host exist" test.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Lots of their mail goes to 10000000 VERIFIED EMAIL ADDRESSES,
meaning people like <b
	>mlr@ssc.com</b> who don't work here any more,
or Qr457.1121212???@ssc.com who never did.  These bounce, but
our MTA can't raise a connection from the putative source,
so they just park on the queue for a week or so.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Every couple of days I go look for new stuff on the queue
from MAILER-DAEMON with "Connection refused" errors.  Then
I add them to a reject file, and henceforth mail claiming to
be from anybody at the "From:" domain gets
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>550 You refuse our connections so we refuse yours
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Non-retryable.  I figure we don't knock off <EM>too</EM> many
legit domains, since these usually don't keep refusing connections
for very long, and MAILER-DAEMON doesn't have much traffic
for legit domains anyway.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Each morning I get mailed the list of 100 or so mails that
were so refused, and I vette for stuff that might be legit.
Mostly it's the same bogus "From:" hammering ten or twenty
users at SSC, more than half of whom never existed.

Hello Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have a network of machines which use Linux and Windows95.  This is not
a Windows95 question!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here's what I have.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1. The network address, of the ethernet LAN, is 192.93.16.0 (a Motorola block).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
2. I use a dialup connection, using a modem, to access my ISP, and I use
wvdial to dial things up.  The Linux machine is the one connected to the
Internet.  It is my router.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
3. I use the <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 6.4 Linux distribution (with the 2.2.14 kernel).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
4. I use ipchains to set up my rules.  The commands are listed below.  It's
in a shell script.
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tag/ipchains-masq.sh.txt">ipchains-masq.sh.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
I can browse the Web (from my Windows machine) with no problem.  When I
use the ftp client, on the Windows machine, I can log in to the ftp site
(ftp.cdrom.com, for example), and I can get the prompt.  When I type "ls"
or "dir", I get the indication that the PORT command is successful, and
nothing else happens.  Things appear to stall.
</STRONG></P>

There's a special kernel module (ip_masq_ftp) to allow FTP to pass through an
IP-masqueraded gateway.  See the Networking section in the kernel
configuration.

I have seen a posting on the SuSE site about this very problem, but, I have
not yet found an answer.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I will continue troubleshooting this problem on my own, but if anybody
else (probably everybody) has seen the behavior of ipchains and ftp clients
on other machines, it would be cool if you let me know.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I suspect that this is a simple configuration problem.  I looked at the
IP-CHAINS HOWTO, and I looked at the IP-MASQUERADING HOWTO, but, I have not
found anything yet.  I will look at them again, just to see if I missed
anything.  I will also search the Linux Gazette site again.  I may just have
a mental block.

RealAudio, Quake, IRC, CUSeeMe and VDO-Live also require their own separate
modules, at least on kernel 2.2.  On kernel 2.4, those modules don't seem to
exist, although ip_nat_ftp does exist.

Yep; there's an entire kit of various ip_masq_* modules, including IRC,
RealAudio, VDOLive, CuSeeme, and so on. You can usually find these under

The broader issue is that the normal automatic kernel loading
mechanism (kmod) wasn't working.  You probably want to run
depmod (build your kernel module dependency tree file) and try
running modprobe (which attempts to find and load modules
<EM>including</EM> their dependents).  If the modprobe command doesn't
work by hand, then the kmod (kernel module loader) won't either
--- since kmod spawns off kernel threads to execute modprobe
commands.

Actually, "depmod -a" runs every time you boot - at least on my <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> box;
that's what prints the "Calculating module dependencies..." line.  It's in
"<TT>/etc/init.d/modutils</TT>". I'm not sure how it works on SuSE.

I think that I did that depmod stuff when I rebuilt the kernel (to add
enhanced support for my hard disk controller), but I will take this advice
into account.  Maybe I THINK that I did the required stuff.  It was more
than 8 months ago (an eternity in my world).

It's also possible that something might be wrong with your

As well, it's worth checking "<TT>/etc/modutils/aliases</TT>" and
"<TT>/etc/modutils/arch/i386</TT>" files; if they don't have the correct lines in
them, "update-modules" will not have what it needs to build
"<TT>/etc/modules.conf</TT>" correctly.

I'm also running masquerading with a 2.2.x (2.2.20), and I just put the
modules in the ipchain script to have them loaded.  I don't see that SuSE

Which script are you talking about?  I just put everything in a bash script.
Is that what you are talking about?  I would look at the man page for
ipchains, but I am on a system that I am just installing Linux, thus,
ipchains (and its man page) are not installed.  I just got the ppp link,
sendmail, and mutt configured on this machine.

On my SuSE 7.1 <TT>/etc/modules.conf</TT> gets used to declare the modules, and looks
like the file which Debian's modutils normally composes out of loose parts.
(for Debian fans,
I'll note that it'll do that whenever you run 'update-modules' as root.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
While it can be argued that the loose parts make it easier to keep things
organized, I'll note that with or without, it's a mess pretty quickly when
you like to toggle amid a handful of kernel versions.  Luckily modules that
don't exist merely issue a harmless warning.

Okay, I just double checked my <TT>/etc/modules.conf</TT> file.  It has all of the
cool stuff for setting up sound....., but nothing is mentioned (in the file)
for my ftp masquerading module.  This is the file that I manually have to
set up with the SuSE 6.4 distribution.  Oh well,  I'll read more about this
stuff.

kmod works by intercepting attempts to use device drivers,
networking protocols, filesystem types and other resources
that <EM>might</EM> be provided through kernel modules, suspending the
process that requested those resources, mapping the requested resource
to some provider module and attempting to modprobe that provider.
As I've said, modprobe attempts to recursively load each of the
modules on which its target depends.

Also, that 'display' shows the file doesn't prove it's a normal image type -
display speaks Freetype!

This isn't obvious because it doesn't <EM>insist</EM> on it;  there's a call to make
if you want to ask if a library is around to use, after you load.  The better
gtk and Gnome apps sometimes use it, so that they can use plain xlibs if the
glitzier things aren't around.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(on my box it says it can't find Freetype, right before it fails to display
the font, on fonts which otherwise work just fine.  GIMP sees 'em all because
of xfstt.  Maybe my own "X 4 won't honor truetype" problem is that it doesn't
find the lib, and my xfstt does, or is static.  Hmm.)

OK, so to cut through all the bull... A couple of minutes ago, I downloaded
the font that Leo mentioned. Looks pretty standard to "file" (BTW,
"display" can't see it).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I unzipped it with the "-L" switch (I like my filenames in lower case,
thank you), and moved it into "<TT>/usr/share/fonts/truetype/</TT>". Then, I shut
down the "xfstt" TrueType server, ran "xfstt --gslist --sync", started
"xfstt" back up, and ran "xset fp+ unix/:7101" to let X know that it had a
TT server running.

The real thing is managed by a triplet of files, which if kept all in sync,
all is happy. Those three files are fonts.dir, fonts.scale, fonts.alias.
fonts.dir and fonts.scale look exactly the same... the first line is a count
of how many fonts, and the rest are X-style control lines, where the first
word is the filename (foo.ttf) and the rest is a set of dash-separated
parameters.  The fonts.alias file looks the same except, there is no count
line, and the ".ttf" gets stripped off.  You can also add aliases for other
popular spellings of things ("Comic Sans" and "MS Comic Sans" as seperate
lines for the same font mscomicsans which is really comc.ttf), but I'm
generally too lazy.

It also generates the files fonts.dir and
fonts.scale (whileas fonts.alias isn't needed by X to work).

Strictly speaking, I don't think the font service doesn't need fonts.scale
either ...  it's used by mkfontdir (or its cousins) along with the real fonts,
to compose fonts.dir.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
All my fonts.* files are in fine shape;  xfstt uses fonts.dir the same way
that standard xfs does, it just being the same server with a patch for
freetype support.

The top number in these is a count of the following font lines; I've
glanced at a couple of these, and that's what it adds up to. &lt;shrug&gt; I
guess that whoever wrote the software didn't feel like counting them. It
looks like a mapping of all the actual font names (the front part of the
string) into the type of font spec that X expects.

Heh. It's a glorified frequency counter (I throw away the actual count of
"items", so it just does a "uniq"):
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>-w 	enable warnings

</font></code></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>/\.ttf\b/&amp;&amp;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
If a line matches '.ttf' which is immediately followed by a word
boundary, then...
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>$x{$F[1]}++
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
...using the second member of the "@F" array ($F[1]) as a key in the %x
hash, increment the value assigned to that key. This will build a hash with
every unique name as a key, and the values reflecting how many times that
key appeared.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>END{print int keys %x}
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The END block, just like in "awk", runs only once, after the main loop has
finished. So, once "%h" is loaded up, we extract the list of keys from it.
"print keys %x" would have printed the list itself; "print int keys %x"
enforces scalar context on the list, and just prints the number of items in
it. Typical example of Perl context sensitivity.

Ok here's the thing now: I added the dir entry (as suggested earlier by
someone else) in <TT>/etc/X11/XftCache</TT> and now there's a XftCache file
appearing in my fonts folder. Some of the fonts that don't appear in
fonts.dir appear in my new XftCache. Example entry:

<pre><strong>"sushi.ttf" 0 "Sushi

Note that just having the right fonts.* files in my truetype directory aren't
enough to make it happy, either.  If it helps, the home page for xfstt is...
uh... if you believe <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A>, it doesn't have one.  But you can download iti
from ibiblio.  The same place also mentions xfsft, which uses Freetype
directly, and is much better known.  Of course I went to <EM>its</EM> homepage and
learn that he no longer maintains it seperately now that it is happily merged
into Xfree86 proper. So that answers <EM>my</EM> question anyway.

<blockQuote><ul>
<li> use xfstt or another "external" font server to translate your TTF fonts
to a standard X protocol font

<li>
 find and/or properly install Freetype libraries on your system, making sure
that ld.so.conf agrees with you on this subject.  Don't forget to use
ldconfig to make it update the libraries locations.  Also don't forget it
searches through the locations in the order listed, so if you've a bogus
library in there (an old rev maybe?) you really do need to take it out.

The mouse in question is a Microsoft IntelliMouse (optical). It is

This way X will not complain if the usb mouse is not there (but will not

Rather than suggesting a specific driver, which is only a small part of the

possible to get in my chase; I would say that you should be able to resolve
your problem without too much trouble, since there's a whole section
dedicated to USB mice. Go to <A HREF="http://www.linux-usb.org"
	>http://www.linux-usb.org</A>, and read the stuff
in order, starting at the top (you can skip the sections that don't apply,

Failing that, you actually may find it possible to make the USB subsystem
more stable by compiling the correct USB "hub" driver into your kernel.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In this case UHCI support.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I also note that one of the USB hub flavors, UHCI ... yes, that's right,
the one you are using ... has two different possible drivers to use for
basic hub support.  <EM>I</EM> have never discovered any difference using either
one, but maybe your system wants "the other one" .  You can try it as a
module first and see.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Anyways my dad-in-law has a usb keyboard that lets the mouse plug into its
back "piggyback" style - and we got better USB behavior by building usb-uhci
into the kernel.   Very minor difference, but he lives in X, and mouses
being strange on you don't make a happy GUI.

That was actually what worked for me, but I wanted him to have the big
picture: understanding the USB process and tweaking the few small variables
seems to be the way to go. I got <EM>this</EM> close with the Palm Pilot, even
though it's not supported yet: got USB to recognize it as a valid device
(!), one that did not get dropped... I wish I knew more about writing
drivers and protocol parsers, but it's about #16,761 on the priority list.

I can't contribute much, but maybe you can get it to work again
by removing the module (looks like a module to me) and inserting it
again. I'm not sure if some other module has to be removed and
inserted first. Try <TT>/sbin/lsmod</TT> to see if it is a module (and being
used) and then rmmod usb-uhci and modprobe usb-uhci. Give it a try,
maybe it works.

Yep. Rebooting is unnecessary; you can just unload/reload the module - but
the problem is that the module that you're using is generating or missing a
ton of spurious interrupts, which eventually brings it to its knees.

So now I tried this again:
on disconnect the mouse (reciever) is dropped from valid input devices
(Xserver)
reconnecting the mouse will leave it unused.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
restarting X will not find the mouse on <TT>/dev/usbmouse0</TT> as usually.
restarting with config entry pointing to <TT>/dev/usbmouse1</TT> does find the mouse
and it's working again.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Changing a link which is in the Config to point to the right device after a
disconnect/reconnect does <EM>not</EM> work.
Restarting X with the  same link to ...mouse1 will work.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I guess you should fiure out why your mouse gets disconnected, everything
else is lots of trouble and strange things happening.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But basically restarting X with the right mouse device should suffice,
rebooting the whole system is not necessary here. But my mouse gets
reconnected without error, yours not.

However, nothing will help if your mousie's little USB plug doesn't like
staying in the socket.  If you have a machine with more than one USB socket
try the other one and see if it clears up suddenly.  In which case you'll
either need to give up on the flimsy socket, or use it only for devices
that aren't so darn picky.

Probably not; most folks tend to run just one distro. I can certainly see
wanting to experiment, though.

Linux is flexible enough that there is no single recommended
way to get multiple Linux distributions installed on the same
system.  There are lots of ways you can do it and each can meet
some needs, while each requires you to understand how UNIX and
Linux work "under the hood" and each may entail various tricks
to implement.

One of my friends has a dual-boot laptop:  Redhat because he needed to
understand the environment at work; <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> because he wanted to see a dif't

W2k is the hard part.  I don't have any MSwin boxen right now, but the generic
procedure over the years has been:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>install Windows.  expect it to take over the whole drive.
	(obviously this is much easier if it came with MSwin already)

<LI>get all its apps settled in as happy campers

<LI>defrag and get the swap volume away from the end of the disk

<LI>resize its partition to give you a bunch of empty space.
	DO NOT format this space under mswin.

<LI>boot off your linux install media

<LI>reconfigure the blank space only.  Depending on your resizer you
      may have to delete a bogus D: (second vfat) to give you the space
      clear.

Huh. All I've ever done is one of the two:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Install basic Wind*ws.

<LI>Use "FIPS" or whatever to split off whatever I want of the remainder.

<LI>Install Linux.
</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
or
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Boot with Tom's RootBoot or some other quickie; partition the HD.

<LI>Install Wind*ws in one.

<LI>Install Linux in others.
</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I've never had a problem... I think it may be that Wind*ws recreates its
swap file as needed. If I ever suspected it of giving me problems, I would
just delete it.

Merely basic paranoia.  I've been doing that sort of thing for a long while
and MSwin 3.1 wasn't really happy about it.  However it was quite easy to
"defarg" - just tell it you feel like going with no swap file, and after
giving you the "living dangerously, eh?" rant, it would let you.

Trust me, swap doesn't give a rat's patooties.  Unless you're using swsusp
patches (in which case, join the Gang, we could use your expertise) there's
no reason for it to, either.

See the "Windows sharing Swap with Linux" HOWTO, I forget which one it is,
but it's definitely on linuxdoc.org and therefore in most of your major
distros too.

Now *there's* something you can share, whatever passes for the <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> (LDP) mirror

"boot"... eh, it may be possible, but you may be opening a can of
worms; I would separate everything as much as possible (this assumes that
disk space is not an issue - since you're talking about installing multiple
distros, I'm taking that as a given.)

Boot is a much happier thing if it's early on the disk - esp if you're planning
to experiment with off-brand boot loaders.  So having One Place For Kernels is
a good thing.  Making them keep their modules with them, means less headaches
later.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To do this trick, you'll need room for the modules as well as the kernel
itself.  This kit has been getting larger as time goes on, too.  So you
should have more like a 20 MB <TT>/boot</TT> or 40 MB instead of 5-7 MB. (40 MB is
probably room for 3 to 5 kernels and their stuff)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
After you have distro #1 installed:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>	cd /lib
<br>	cp -a modules /boot/modules
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
{chug chug}
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>	mv modules MOVING
<br>        ln -s /boot/modules modules

<blockQuote>
After you have distro #2 installed:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>	cd /lib/modules
<br>	cp -a * /boot/modules/

OK, I understood the part about mounting the "Mandrake" partition... could
you explain what you mean by 'put the <EM>boot file</EM> in "lilo.conf"'? As far
as I know, the only things you can put in "lilo.conf" are "lilo" keywords,
things like stanzas that specify partitions to boot, etc. What's a "boot
file"?

No.  You cannot share <TT>/etc.</TT>  I have tried and it's broken and wicked.  Too
many variations of apps have slightly different control structures in dif't
software revisions.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The closest I can offer you there is that you can mount <TT>/home</TT> and assign
each major app that you are going to keep in sync on all N distros -- e.g.
apache or bind -- their own "home" for their control files, and again put
in a symlink for the applicable place.  But that symlink has to be named
what the <EM>distro</EM> expects... if one wants <TT>/etc/httpd</TT> and another wants
<TT>/etc/apache</TT>, you will break things if you try to "normalize" them.
</blockQuote>

For <TT>/home</TT> be careful about dotfiles.  More on that later.

Well, in theory, what you want to do shouldn't be that hard: you'd just end
up with a lot of partitions. Or not - since you're experimenting, and are
presumably going to blow all this stuff off at some point, you don't have
to be quite as persnickety about carefully isolating everything.

When you add the modules into this, 30 MB or 40 is more like it,
but <EM>well worth</EM> the synchronized behavior you get.  Also if you roll your

and so on; mount <TT>/hda2</TT> on "<TT>/home</TT>" for all of them. Slightly crude, but
effective - and a lot of people have their 'regular' running setup done
this way (I did, for several years.) When you're done experimenting -
presumably you will be, at some point - you can blow off that partition
structure, all except the first two, slice the remainder to taste, and
garnish with a little bit of ext3 or ReiserFS. Yum.

It's also possible (with a little fussing) to install a set of
different Linux distributions such that they all share one
<TT>/boot</TT> partition (which just holds kernels, System.map files,
and a few map, backup and library bits).  A complex lilo.conf file
can then match each distribution's kernel to its root filesystem.
So you might have something like <TT>/boot/vmlinuz-SuSE-2.4.14</TT>
matched to <TT>/dev/hda7</TT> (it's root fs).  Thus you select SuSE and
lilo picks the kernel, passes it a root=/dev/hda7 (and possibly
some other parameters) and you're in your SuSE system.  All of
your distributions can share the same <TT>/boot</TT> and <TT>/home</TT>, <TT>/usr/local</TT>
or other ancillary filesystems --- but each can get its own
root, usr, and var (which can be separated or combined in just
about any way that suits your fancy).

Oh, I'd be careful about <TT>/home</TT> ... beware of what the dotfiles in your
user home directories might get themselves into.  Some apps like The GIMP
are written well for the expectation they'll be revised.  Some others
(like Netscape 4 vs Netscape 6) may not be so inclined to do the right
thing.  Avoiding having dotfiles at all for any apps you just don't use
helps a lot.

The fussing is just in the installation.  In some cases the
easiest installation procedure might be to start with an extra
(small) hard disk, install the distro into a suitably small
partition or set of partitons on that; back that whole system up,
and then restore it to a set of manually created and mounted
partitions on your main hard drive.

Bill Schoolcraft, a talented and enthusiastic Linux support
professional with whom I had the great pleasure of working while
I was at <A HREF="http://www.linuxcare.com/">Linuxcare</A>, had his desktop system configured with about
a dozen different Linux distributions using some scheme like
I've just described.  He also had <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A>, and "Open"-Solaris
x86 installations on that or some other system.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Under this scheme its also possible, and reasonably safe, to
try mixing and matching the kernels from any one distribution
with the root/usr filesystems of any other.  All of that will
mostly work, though you might find some programs complaining about
missing support for one or another optional kernel features.

It's also possible to mount up the "alien" filesystems in
just about any silly combination you like.  So you could boot
into your RedHat 7.2 kernel with its rootfs (all on ext3, perhaps)
and mount your SuSE/Reiserfs rootfs under <TT>/mnt/suse</TT> (or wherever).
This is possible because the RedHat 7.2 kernel has reiserfs support
linked into it, though it's practically undocumented.  If you
stick with ext2 for all of your filesystems then there will be
no problem sharing those under any distribution you could find.
If you try to mount a RedHat 7.2 ext3 filesystem under a S.u.S.E
6.x distribution it might fail or (because of ext3 backwards
compatibility to ext2) it might work but have some odd effects
if you hadn't cleanly unmounted/shutdown the fs when it was
mounted under an ext3 capable kernel).

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Could it possibly be a problem with Reiser -  I know that SUSE (7 and

reiser does not play nicely with ext2/3 especially in boot/root
partition - worth looking at

Of course you can also build your own kernels and ensure that
they have support for <EM>all</EM> of the features you need from
all of your distributions and for all of your filesystems.  This
isn't any more difficult than building a kernel for "just one"
system and distribution.  (There isn't that much difference
in features among the distributions at the kernel level.  Most of
those apply to special packages, like Oracle, or special hardware
like some chipsets and adapters that are common in Europe and
obscure on this side of the pond, etc).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Yet another technique is to install a copy of VMWare (commercial
software) and use it to create a number of "vdisks" (disk images)
and then to install different distributions into each of those.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
And, of course, it's often possible to keep a small stack of
extra hard drives around, and some laptops have carriers and
brackets that make swapping drives relatively convenient.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, you're really only limited by your own creativity and
willingness.  Do the "Schoolcraft" thing: install a dozen
distributions on that 60Gb hard disk today!

Now today it told me that after 20 remounts it is going to check my
filesystem and it was running e2fsck (1.25 Sep 2001) on the partition.
It found some minor i-node problems, corrected automatically and
after that the  normal ext3 messages during the mount stage came up and
everything seemd fine.

<P><STRONG>
So:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Is this normal behaviour of ext3? Should I switch off the fschk in the

not know about ext3 yet. reiserfs is explicitly handled in the boot script
as reiser is installed and configured by SuSE.

&lt;Wince&gt; That's probably not a good idea. I would set it to some reasonably

thanks to both for the fast reply,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So even with ext3 journaling it's advisable to run fsck occasionally? And
running a reasonably new fsck.ext3 (which actually runs e2fsck 1.25) is ok?
Will not damage anything -- also not in case of an unclean shutdown?
In case of an unclean shutdown it should just replay the journal and not
actually run a full fsck, right?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Then I would set the various partitons on the one HD to some largish 2 digit
prime numbers and let an occasional fsck run on them.

Uptime on my servers are huge.  With autofsck set to one hundred mounts,
you will run fsck maybe once every 8 years?  Yes it is good to run fsck

takes nearly 20 mins to fsck that beast.

not really. <EM>IF</EM> I stop X <EM>AND</EM> unload the NVidia driver it will suspend and

failed tries. And S2D is not configured (yet). But not worth doing anyway

preserve whatever I was working on on the screen.

The only difference between ext2 and ext3 is the journal.  You can mount
an ext3 fs as ext2. So yes,  it is good to run fsck at regular
intervals.  I prefer to schedule mine, others prefer the mount count to
do it.  Choose what suits you best.

OK, but in order to make adjustments, doesn't fsck need to be run the fs
when mounted as read-only?  And IIRC, running it on the fs when mounted rw
can screw things up, no?

Make sure not to do <TT>/dev/hda</TT> itself -- it's <EM>the entire drive</EM>.  The thing
you're fsck'ing has to be a partition of the ext3 variety.

That is setup by SuSE quite ok -- initially <TT>/</TT> is mounted ro, checked, then
all others are checked with special treatment for reiserfs, all other
partitions are still unmounted at the point.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Then <TT>/</TT> will be remounted for rw and all other get mounted and system
runlevel changes to the specified one (2 in my case, which is multi-user,
network but textloging).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was just wondering if I'm supposed to run fsck on ext3 at all -- but that
is cleared up by now.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
just running a fsck from time to time is maybe more convenient. I would like
to avoid random longish boottimes -- it's always when you wait for the Lap

When things go bang in the server room, it should just replay the

Yes. You need apm support in your kernel. In 2.2.x times there were not too

That's no Linux problem at all. Your Linux system shuts down the machine
and powers it off, the same way as Windows does, right? And you can go
away for 2 hours, and no fan spins and no harddrive nor video card is
active. But you double click with your mouse and the computer boots.
That's a BIOS feature. Power On on Mouse event, or something like that.
You have to disable it in the BIOS -&gt; Power Management menu.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The ATX boards have this option, they are not completely off if powered
down, so they can use features like Power on on mouse click or power on on
keyboard event or Wake-On-LAN. Maybe your PC has a power switch on the
back, near the power cord. It completely powers off the PC (same as if you
would pull the plug ...)

There was however a recent tidbit on debian-laptops, that some APM will not
work - and therefore not properly turn off the machine even after shutdown -
with APIC support turned on.  This makes sense as that's some nice features
from the SMP world for uniprocessors (if I understood the kernel source
help notes;  y'all are free to correct me).  This <EM>seriously</EM> affects laptop
users, who don't want a reboot sequence to pause and waste extra juice if
they had to change kernel options.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Many laptops no longer properly support APM, since they don't bother to even
try debugging that it works (since the Borg from Redmond have very nice ACPI
support)...  and I would not be terribly surprised if some desktop motherboards
are the same. Reports are that ACPI for Linux is actually usable for menial
day to day use like turning the whole box off properly, and suspend/resume
to some mild degree of usability.  But a lot of work still needs to be done
for drivers to support different sleep levels.

BTW: many kernels kill not support APM (soft power switch for
desktop systems) under an SMP (symmetrical multi-processor) kernel.
I've heard that there are inherent race conditions, design flaws
in the APM spec, that makes most APM functions dangerous in an SMP
environment.  Newer kernels seem to have an option to allow limited
APM functionality (specific soft power switch control) even on SMP
desktops.  Read the kernel configuration help pages (make menuconfig,
select "Help" from the dialog) and the kernel docs (under
<TT>/usr/src/linux/Documentation</TT>) and maybe search Google!

Have you looked through the Mandrake documentation and the Linux HOWTOs
at <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org"

We are more likely to answer your question if you show you've put some

... which might answer your question.  BTW (by the way) it's a
good idea to re-iterate your question in the body of your e-mail,
since some mail-user agents (clients) truncate the subject line,
and others just put subject and other header lines in the periphery
of the screen, or on completely separate windows, screens, etc.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course I cheated a little bit.  I included the term "mount"
(which is how we usually read from, write to, and other manipulate
filesystems under UNIX and Linux, by "mounting" them unto a directory
under our filesystem) and the company name of the Zip Drive's
manufacturer "Iomega" --- so my search might be more effective than
one which didn't include these bits of metadata.  On the other hand
searching Google! with just "read 250 zip" yielded similar results,
but the link I gave was moved to second place.  With the additional
terms it was the topmost item.  If I go to regular Google (rather than
Google!Linux) and I use the less specific search term (excluding the
term Linux) then I get a bunch of irrelevant results.  (But including
"linux" in the search term at the top level, generic Google! gets
the same results as going to Google!Linux).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course there are other search engines, and there are many other
results returned by these queries.  So any of them might answer
your question.  However, if everyone used these techniques effectively,
then the answer gang would only get "hard" questions.

If the client were doing a read on the socket, it would get an end of file
indication when the server closes the connection.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
When the server closes its end of the socket, a TCP FIN segment is sent by
the server side.  The client's TCP will send an ACK segment, and the client
will be given an end of file on its next read of the socket.  Under this TCP
half-close situation, the client can continue sending data to the server.
When the client is finished writing its data, it then closes its end of the
connection.  The client TCP then sends a TCP FIN segment, and the server TCP
sends an ACK segment.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm surprised that an error occurs during a write to the socket when the
server closes its end of the connection.  I'm not sure what happens under
the scenario that you are describing, but, the variable errno should give
some indication of the type of error that had occurred.  I cannot remember
off hand what the error code would be.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But the <TT> shutdown()</TT> command (associated with sockets) must
be used for this half-close situation to occur.  Also, the literature states
that very few applications use the half-close feature of TCP.

I was just reading my "Unix Network Programming" textbook, and it mentions
that if the connection is terminated, a signal, with a value of SIGPIPE,
is sent to the process that tried to perform a read on socket.

</DL></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It shows some "C" code that, I think, confirms what I believe.  A SIGPIPE
signal will be generated and sent to the process that initiated the write
on the socket with the now closed server connection.  The client would just
to catch the signal, and the event would be detected, thus, the client
could perform its desired response to the event (the server terminating the
connection).

I've read up on this stuff since, and I believe that you're right - as long
as it's understood that it's not the <EM>server</EM> itself that sends the
SIGPIPE; it's part of the IPC, which is handled by the kernel. As an
example, here is The Proper Way to raise a kid who reads:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>  # Open a buffer to be dumped to a process; defined by the leading "|".
  open SPOO, "|txt2gif 2&gt;/dev/null" or die "Can't fork: $!\n";

  # Declare a local trap; $SIG{PIPE}'s current value is saved and will be
  # restored on exit. This is the part that most folks forget to do.
  local $SIG{ PIPE } = sub { die "ENOTOBACCO: Broken pipe error!\n" };

  # Send some STUFF to the buffer; unless autoflush is enabled, the data
  # will just sit there until...
  print SPOO "Bar foo fraggle garp\n";

  # ...we actually flush it into the pipe, here.
  close SPOO or die "Bad spool: Papa spank! $? $!\n";

The DMA interrupt handler in the IDE driver seems to detect a data
transfer failure (BadCRC) 4 times consecutively. All drives present on
the corresponding IDE interface are then reset; in such a case (at least
if you run a 2.4.x kernel), (U)DMA is disabled on <EM>both</EM> drives, even
though you're told so only for your <TT>/dev/hdb</TT> CDROM (don't ask me why
the kernel people have chosen to do so - one would have expected the
faulty drive, hda, to be mentioned in a `DMA disabled' message as well

If dma is enabled on a controller that is not well supported, these
errors can appear.  ( I had it on a VIA KT266a with kernel 2.2.
Upgrading to kernel 2.4 fixed it beautifully.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you are sure that the IDE controller is supported, the drive is on
its way out.  You can run fsck with the badblock option turned on to
mark these blocks as bad... As a rule, once these errors start, we throw
the disk away(This is a high availability production environment).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you dont mind that the disk can crash in the near future, make a
backup and continue using it, it might work for a long time to come.

If the disk is under guarantee... take it back, it is not worth risking
data loss if the drive can be replaced for free.

You can pass an `ide=nodma' option to the boot loader to achieve this.
Note that in the present case you'd better remove the `hdparm' line
from your bootup script (-d1 is for forcing DMA on). Unfortunately I
don't think it can be done on a per-drive basis (nor even on a
per-interface basis).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To clarify, (U)DMA at kernel startup can only be <EM>globally</EM> disabled.
You'll have then to fiddle with the hdparm utility
to change this for a given drive (at your own risks).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There doesn't seem to be any `hdx=nodma'
(x = 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd') nor `idex=nodma' (x = '0' or '1') kernel
options available at present -- the so-called note has been inserted
at a wrong place

This number is most probably the log level associated to the given kernel

KERN_WARNING level). A log level of &lt;0&gt; is for emergency conditions

Hi there,
I beleive that dma_intr implies that a DMA interrupt occurred that is
associated with your hard disk controller.  You might be getting a Seek
Complete error due to a bad CRC.  In other words, either your media (the
actual sectors of your hard disk platter) might be corrupt, or you might
have a problem with your cabling.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Before I trashed the drive, I would unplug and replug the IDE cable from
your disk controller AND your hard drive.  Your disk controller might
reside on your motherboard, and in that case, you would unplug the cable
from the motherboard.  You might also try a different IDE cable (the 40-pin
ribbon cable) between your disk and the disk controller.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I start to worry when I see the BadCRC error messages, because when that
happened to me, the hard disk eventually became useless.  Make sure that
you back up any data that you want to keep.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I saw those error messages on my son's computer when I gave him one of my
hard drives that happened to be laying around.  It was a 2Gb hard drive.
At first, the messages were an annoyance during boot up.  As time passed,
we could not even get the system to boot up without running through fsck.
Finally, things got so bad that fsck couldn't fix the filesystems.  The
drive is now on display, in parts, so that my son can show off the disk
platters to his friends.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Good luck, and don't forget to back up your data.

tftp (it has been a while since using it.) is an acronym for trivial
file transfer protocol. It is a tiny insecure little ftp server that is
great for getting kernels of a boot server to start diskless machines.
I am sure it runs UDP as opposed to TCP/IP. As an ftp server it is
useless.

in the documentation about one. I would like to have one that uses the
existing security which the users have in linux. IE when I ftp in, I will
have the same rights as my login name would if I signed onto the terminal.
Is this possible? I would assume it is, but we all know what happens when we
assume.

It's possible.  Setup varies from ftp server to ftp server.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Whether this is really what you want is another matter.  FTP passwords
are exchanged in plain text over the internet, for any snooping
eyes to sieze upon.  Allow ssh or telnet login also, and you're
exposing yourself to a moderate threat of having accounts hijacked.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If that doesn't bother you, or if the privileges associated with
the accounts are minimal, go ahead.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Generally when I set up a named ftp account, I also make the user's
login shell <TT>/bin/false.</TT>

If you set the users account to <TT>/bin/false</TT>, please add <TT>/bin/false</TT> to
/etc/shells.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The defualt pam setup requires a valid shell. Or remove the line
`auth       required     <TT>/lib/security/pam_shells.so</TT>' in <TT>/etc/pam.d/ftp.</TT>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The last option is a bad idea. man `pam' for details. It could allow all
kinds of strange ftp logins as user lp, bin etc.

4.12.  How to make CD-ROMs writable like a hard disk?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There is an overlay filesystem available for Linux, which is mounted
over the CD-ROM and intercepts all writing operations. New and
modified files are stored elsewhere, but for the user it looks like
the CD-ROM is modified. For more information, see
<A HREF="http://home.att.net/~artnaseef/ovlfs/ovlfs.html"

<blockQuote>
BTW, the <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.3 live CD writes a file to the FAT partition (approx 80
MB, IIRC) on the hard disk, and keeps config data there.  One can edit
files (don't know what restrictions there are in that regard), and it
"remembers" the changes the next boot.

If he had a functioning DHCP server, he would then manually configure
the NIC and run the DHCP client daemon, dhcpcd. Of course, the DHCP
server would provide the ip address of a name server.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But he doesn't have a functioning DHCP server. Since he can't edit
<TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT> (read-only filesystem, rememeber?) how does he set his
nameserver?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I check the man pages and found that he can set his resolver options and
search domain with enviroment variables, but nothing was said of how to
change/set the nameserver IP(s). I went looking for a program called
'resolv.*' but I couldn't find where the resolver actually resides.

<P><STRONG>
I suggested he mount <TT>/etc/</TT> to a ramdisk, but there should be a more

<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
You're not going to be able to do it, at least not from "the command

resolution is done by calling glibc functions (gethostbyname in my
case).

The code in question lies in glibc-&lt;version&gt;/resolv/res_init.c around
line 230 in my version.  The authors allow for setting resolv.conf's
"domain" and "search" options from enviromant variables (LOCALDOMAIN and
RES_OPTIONS, respectively) but they don't allow any such thing for
nameservers.  Adding the code to read nameservers information from
enviroment variables do that doesn't seem difficult.  Learning how to
compile and debug system libraries under linux, OTOH...

Here I go jumping in the middle of a conversation after I disappear for a
week.  I'm always reading those books by W. Richard Stevens.  These days,
the book is "Unix Network Programming", the 1990 edition.  The newer editions
are in the queue, where he discusses network programming in his first
volume and IPC (including threads) in his second volume.  What's cool
about the first volume of the new edition of "Unix Network Programming" is
that he talks about Linux, too.

I assume you're talking about the hardcoding of <TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT> and not
the lack of reading the nameserver(s) from the enviroment.

So why does that not apply to LOCALDOMAIN and RES_OPTIONS?  I could
force you to search my domain (nefarious.com) by planting a trojan that
sets LOCALDOMAIN.  And, if I read the man pages correctly, I can set
RES_OPTIONS="ndots:0" and force you to search my domain.

At risk of sounding like a broke record, there are a couple of links we
would like to bring to your attention regarding the DMCA (Digital
Millennium Copyright Act), the law used to imprison Dmitry Sklyarov.
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">
The Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
has produced an extensive
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/US_v_Sklyarov/us_v_sklyarov_faq.html">
FAQ</a>
about the Dmitry Sklyarov & ElcomSoft Prosecution.  The information is
of course relevant to a wider range of circumstances than this particular
case, and details the DMCA, fair use, eBooks and the EFF's role in the
case.  This is a good resource for anyone who wants to get the whole crazy
story straight (if that is even possible!).
<P> 
A recent story on 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/">
Slashdot</a>
highlighted how bad this law really is.  Apparently it turns out that
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/14/1745238&mode=nested">
serial cables might be illegal</a>.
The story submitter, Colin McMillen, related how US Customs rejected entry
of a PC-Sega Dreamcast serial cable into the US, even though the cable had
a legitimate academic use.

to the Copyright Term Extensions Act 1998, which extended copyrights
another 20 years.  The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear the challenge,
which is being brought by a coalition of interested parties (publishers,
etc.,) who depend on using material in the public domain.  It will be
interesting to see how this challenge progresses, as the original law was
the result of extensive lobbying by powerful players in the media industry,
notably Disney who would lose control of Mickey Mouse in 2003 under the
original law which gave 75 year protection.  The challenge is being backed
by at least one lawyer most readers will be familiar with: Lawrence Lessig.

US-Patent on perfect machine translation</a>. 
Quoting a little from a post by Hartmut Pilch to the European Patent Office
mailing list:
<blockquote>
"The description is very voluminous and explains a whole new cosmology,
comprising insights about Buddhism illumination, androids, perpetuum
mobiles, subject-object dichotomy and much more.  Based on this
cosmology, a solution to the above-claimed problem seems to become
possible.  At least it should be difficult for an examiner to refute
that it does.  He could ask the inventor to provide a working
reference implementation, but that is not adequate, because only a
key idea of a huge complex system is claimed."

<FONT COLOR="green">Linux, Microsoft and the Bundestag
</FONT>
</H3> 
A group of German citizens concerned that Germany should both exploit
the advantages of free software, and avoid some of the perils of
proprietary software have been lobbying for the introduction of free
software into the German parliament, the Bundestag.
The
<a href="http://www.bundestux.de/english.html">
www.bundestux.de</a> (English and Deutsch) calmly makes the case for free
software in the Bundestag (and indeed in all government), and provides the
opportunity to submit your contact details in support of the sentiments.
<p>
The Register 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23964.html">
reported</a>
that this civil activity was received with hostility by Microsoft Germany,
who felt they were unjustly being labelled as:
"undemocratic and a hindrance to democracy".
The consultants report released later on basically 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24048.html">
divided the spoils</a> [The Register] between Microsoft (recommended for
desktops) and free software (recommended in server/groupware roles).
Microsoft's poor email client security was noted, but was not sufficient to
tip the balance.

Also on the topic of open standards,
The Register

reported</a>
on the

Linux Standard Base</a> (broadly covering system layout)
and the

acquired it, has spun it off.  "As of the beginning of February, LWN

issues remain, and they have only gotten more pressing over time, but we
will have more freedom in how we try to address those issues." LG has long
been a supporter of LWN (after all, we get some of our best links from them!),
and we were

of their difficulties.  We wish the LWN staff the very best of luck.

Distro News is based on the information sent to us by the

a broad view of the Linux scene.  One excellent resource for anyone
interested in choosing a distribution or just in the state of the business
is
<a href="http://www.distrowatch.com/">
DistroWatch.com</a>
which has profiles and comparisons of almost every distribution under the

Linux Weekly News</a>
(for example, 
<a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0221/dists.php3">

existing distros, and distribution releases.

<H1><font color="maroon">Taming The Linux Keyboard (My Programming Adventures in Writing a Console Application for Linux)</font></H1>
<H4>By <a href="mailto:mar22@usa.net">Petar Marinov</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  

<!-- END header -->




It was about a year ago when I ventured into the idea of porting my 
Windows-based console editor to Linux. Naturally, I targeted the text 
console. The editor was designed in a way to facilitate the porting to 
any other text console environment. I have isolated all the 
keyboard input and text output functions in two files, which I planned to 
rewrite whenever a new platform comes to my way. I've supplied two 
different versions of these files for Windows console and plain DOS 
which, I presumed then, validated my initial idea that porting should 
be a simple task.

<p>
My only knowledge about Linux then comprised the GNU compiler package 
obtained by spending a year with its DJGPP port to DOS. While I knew 
how to write, compile, and debug programs in Linux, my knowledge for 
the console was limited to functions like printf() and getch(). As I 
knew how prominent is the role of the text console in Unix, I supposed 
that programming console applications should be really advanced and on 
a par or even better to this in DOS and Windows.

<p>
I pulled the anchor and once underway, I started to gather necessary 
information. Getting the advantage of having the sources of everything, 
I tried to find the good tides by downloading two applications that had 
console oriented text interfaces.

<p>
First it was the ubiquitous MC (Midnight Commander). This program was 
the straw, which everyone that comes from Windows or DOS into the UNIX 
land grabs gasping for a breath in the ocean of the unknown.

<p>
Second it was the TurboVision port to Linux. TurboVision is a popular 
windowing framework for DOS designed in Borland. The company was 
amicable enough to release the sources in public domain and shortly 
after having them in 32-bit DJGPP I found out that there is a Linux 
version as well. This pretty much showed me that there is a resolution 
to my problems. To further milk the ship metaphor, this blew good winds 
in my sails.

<p>
Something has spoiled the nice experience of using MC.  There is 
something rotten in Denmark, as one of the Great used to say. Why ESC 
... is not ESC? In MC when you press ESC it does nothing until you 
press it again and then the two-ESC combination does the action 
supposed for the single ESC. Helloooo, why is that? Read on, to learn 
what dictates the rules here.

<p>
In DOS we had ANSI.SYS. You use printf() with a sequence (starting with 
ESC and hitherto called an ESC-sequence) of funky characters to move 
the cursor, change the color etc, following the needs of the full-text 
screen applications. It was considered primitive and unproductive to 
use ANSI.SYS, and besides fancy ASCII art, nothing serious engaged in 
using this methodology. Advanced libraries offered direct access to the 
video memory which greatly improved the user experience in working with 
console applications. I remember looking in dismay the sources of 
tpcrt.pas of the TurboPower package, where tight assembler code tried 
to squeeze whatever the graphic (maybe we should say "text") card had 
to offer.

<p>
It turned out that what was considered a very primitive way to do full 
screen applications in DOS, is the road to go in UNIX! I needed 
sometime to collect myself after learning one of those basic facts of 
life. Back on my feet
I tried to devise a scheme for taming the beast; I thought that as I 
learn the ESC-sequences and write the functions it would be a dream 
come true.
After some further research I discovered that there is no single 
standard for these ESC sequences! There are different terminals that 
support different set of operations and that one needs to have a whole 
database to properly operate all possible terminals. Why does everything 
grow so complex? I still tremble remembering the waves of the 
aftershock by all the discoveries I made in a single day.

<p>
"Curses" is the king. Long live the king! It turns out that somebody 
has already developed this database and all the functions I need in a 
library originally called "curses". In Linux it is "ncurses". Everyone 
uses it.

<p>
Screen access functions are almost intuitive enough for everyone to 
start immediately utilizing them. "Ncurses" takes care to update only 
the portions of the screen that actually changed, which is a nice 
performance improvement when you use your program in a telnet session 
or any other remote mode to minimize the amount of the transferred data.

<p>
One simple problem I faced was the fact that DOS and Windows color 
attributes do not directly map to "ncurses" color attributes. The 
problem is aggravated by the fact that in "ncurses" I have only 64 
pairs of color and background available. How will I map my 127 possible 
color/background attributes to just 64?! Well, a short analysis 
revealed that my program uses only about 25 distinctive attributes, 
which allows me to fit them nicely in the 64 attributes map that 
"ncurses" uses. It works like that, I have an array of attributes -- my 
pallete. I first go and count how many unique attributes I have. Then 
for each unique attribute, that I dissolve to color and background, I 
create correspondent entry in the "ncurses" color palette. The index of 
this entry (consider it as an ID) is stored in a  secondary array of 
256 bytes (the whole range of Windows and DOS). When I then pass to my 
display function an attribute from my palette it is used as an index in 
this secondary array to extract the correspondent attribute ID that is 
generated by "ncurses". So as long as I do not go beyond 64 unique 
attributes, my program will be happy and will use the good old 256 
attribute values. This allows me to have a single color palette for all 
the platforms that I currently support, where for DOS and Windows it is 
used natively, it is dynamically remapped in Linux.

<p>
The TurboVision port used a direct screen access when running in a text 
mode linux terminal. Temporarily I considered this option, it is still 
possible to add this to my modules, but later I thought that the small 
performance gain simply doesn't worth the effort.

<p>
I had a bad hunch about the keyboard. First just by looking in the key 
definitions in ncurses headers, I noticed that this library basically 
lacks the infrastructure to define rich key combinations. The terminal 
ships all the "extended" keys via ESC sequences which, I don't know 
why, prevents you from getting single ESC as an ESC and you are always 
required to press ESC twice for your program to receive it once. Plus 
you have only a certain number of key codes, which I presume are 
derived from an ancient crippled terminal, and nothing creative 
happened to the definitions since then. Compare this to Windows, and 
even in DOS, where you can have an ASCII translation of a key, then you 
can have the keys as position codes and you can always have the shift 
state of the keyboard. In Windows you are delivered, via a standard 
API, different events as key pressed and key released. It sounds 
natural, isn't it? Well, because it is so natural, UNIX faithful to its 
orthodox approach to these matters defines everything in an extremely 
crippled model. Working this way is maybe good for improving your 
mental stamina, but believe me, is totally unproductive if you would 
like to achieve something fast.

<p>
Then I was unable to make ncurses operate with a 0 timeout when reading 
a key. Add to this the double ESC syndrome, the total lack of any roads 
to extend this, and in a while you look as an abandoned donkey in a 
desert with a water for just couple of hours. I always have a bottle of 
Evian within reach, I needed no more evidences that while "ncurses" 
support for the display is adequate, its keyboard support beyond some 
very basic functionality is totally irrelevant to my needs. I started 
to think how to maintain the whole keyboard business with my own code.

<p>
The keyboard is a file -- stdin. I never thought I will use stdin in a 
full screen program but, as you can suspect, this is the way to go in 
Unix. The stdin file transports everything in ASCII codes and keys like 
the arrows form a sequence that starts with ESC. At first the 
impression is that if ESC is a start of sequence then the key ESC 
itself should be ESC-caped as well. That is the way "ncurses" go. 
That's why in MC we need to press ESC twice.

<p>
Beside delivering all the ASCII codes and the ESC sequences, the 
keyboard module needs to supply a kbhit() function. In the 
documentation "ncurses" promises that its getch() function can work 
with a 0 timeout, thus never blocking when there is no key in the 
buffer. Maybe a plan like mine starts to form in your mind, I will use 
getch() with 0 timeout, then I will have a small sleep(xxx) and this 
loop will exit whenever a key is pressed. This sounds good in theory, 
but "ncurses" is short on delivering on this specific feature. Its 
maybe something that I didn't do right, or I used old version, or maybe 
it is something else, I may eventually even look at the sources of the 
"ncurses". I didn't want to go that deep, the whole keyboard model 
looked totally outdated, fixing a small flaw in "ncurses" wouldn't have 
helped me, I thought.

<p>
I need basically this: 1. kbhit(). I need to check for a key and exit. 
2. I need to be able to read something like Ctrl+Shift+Left_Arrow. 3. I 
need to exit with a timeout if for sometime a key is not pressed.

<p>
For anything of this to happen one needs to put the keyboard stdin file 
in a row mode. By default you enter lines of text, which are send to 
your program only after the user presses Enter. So to be able to read a 
single character you need to switch to a row mode. The stdin file may 
not only serve a keyboard but may get characters via a serial cable, 
yes, only 3 wires should be enough to manipulate a whole machine. For a 
serial connection to operate properly you need to maintain flow 
control. This could be done by adding 2 additional wires for each of 
the talking sides to request "stop sending me characters" and when the 
buffer is empty to ask "now start dumping again". But adding 2 wires 
may prove expensive and even complex, and this shuttle in the space, 
who knows, something may happen if we introduce this extra level of 
hardware complexity. What one can not do with the hardware makes up 
with the software, a host of characters (in fact 31) is wasted to not 
only maintain the flow control but to switch modes of echoing, the 
canonicality (whew, this is a word, a?!) etc. As you may already know 
these 31 characters are the control characters that populate the lower 
district of the ASCII table. While this sounded as a good idea 20 years 
ago now pressing Ctrl+S to suspend the output on the screen looks 
arcane to me, and I need to use Ctrl+S to save the current file. It 
smells like the keyboard needs some extra massaging to fit into the 
shape I need. So the setup function easily grows beyond the lines of a 
single screen, after some hours of reading documentation and 
experimentation I managed to come up with something that actually 
works. I felt proud, and in this era of people doing space tourism I 
felt that I have my small shred of achievements to show.

<p>
Kbhit() proved to be relatively easy. To wait for a characters 
on a file (or socket), use select(). If you apply this to stdin then 
select() will unblock when someone presses a key. If the timeouts are 
tuned to 0, then it will exit immediately with a failure or success 
code indicating that a key is ready to be read.

<p>
The ReadKey() function has a 2-tier structure (complex isn't it, sounds 
like something that is multi-tire). At the first level I use select() to 
block for incoming characters. When select() unblocks I issue a single 
read() function and try to extract as much as possible. Whatever I 
manage to suck from stdin I store in a fifo queue. On the second level 
the characters are extracted one by one and a string sequence is 
compiled that is matched against an exhaustive list of ESC sequences. 
We have a definite success if we find a matching string. We have a 
definite success if we have a single ESC followed by a time-out. Then 
it is just an ESC, simple! Some code takes place to close the extra 
cases where nothing matches and it is not an ESC etc. All this is 
supplied by a function that extracts the Shift state of the keyboard. 
You may guess that this is a hack that only works in Linux text 
terminals. I learned this from the source code of MC. The downside is 
that this doesn't work outside bare-bones text Linux terminals. Try to 
work in a X terminal and you are dead, no shift key status and no means 
to ever extract it.

<p>
Linux keyboard gives one more advantage in front of any other Unix 
keyboard (that I know of), you may define your own ESC sequences. So, 
if you need for example Ctrl+Shift+F3 you can define this with a new 
ESC sequence and by using the "loadkey" utility to download it into the 
kernel. The changes are immediate and non-permanent. If you reboot you 
need to reexecute the same command with the same definition. I liked 
this, so I added all the key combinations that I used, and were 
undefined in Linux and defined in Windows.

<p>Actually by having the 
function to extract the shift-state, the possible key-combinations one 
needs to explicitly define is greatly decreased. As for example if we 
have Shift+F3 defined, we can get the Control key state and then we have 
Ctrl+Shift+F3. Which without the shift-state function should be defined 
as a new key sequence with "loadkey". A problem surfaces here, which
although subtle, should be well noted. If the extraction of the key
from the keybuffer does not coincide with the time we extract the shift
state we create a big mess. With a great probability (the computers
nowadays a fast enough) we can expect for this not to happen, but hey,
as this is just a probability so mathematicions say the odds are that
sometimes it may actually happen. Example follow. If in my editor F3 is "close
all files and discard changes" and Ctrl+Shift+F3 is assigned to be
"next file", I beg for trouble here. Imagine that F3 is in the buffer
and you can not get the shift state at the same time you will get just
F3 and not "Ctrl+Shift+F3".

<p>
Having stdin as keyboard input has one great advantage, I should admit. 
The editor is subject to a total automation by just supplying an input 
file, provided that you put there the ESC sequences to activate various 
extended keys if necessary.

<p>To scold the enthusiasm in your eyes I should note that ... ostensibly,
full automation is possible, but to a certain extent ... maybe you have
already figured this out, right ... you can not supply the shift states in a
text file. Well, that's life, you can not have your cake and eat it too!

<p>
In Windows a console application works equally well in text mode and in 
a graphical console window. While my module works perfectly well in a 
text linux console ($TERM="linux"), its keyboard support is totaly 
inadequate when started from within X window terminal. All this is 
corollary of the fact that the most common denominator of the UNIX 
keyboards is "unsigned char" and the extended keys use predefined ESC 
sequences that didn't evolve for the last 20 (or more) years. So I'll 
keep working in making my modules X aware. Whenever the program senses 
that it is started from within X terminal it will open a new window 
where all the text output will be emulated with a fixed width font and the 
keyboard will be processed to the best possible extent that X server 
offers.

<p>Eventually what I initially planed proved 
to be doable. It was quite an effort and that is why the victory was 
so sweet.

<H2>Horror Story</H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:CraigR@servex.com.au">Craig Reeson</A>

<P> Here's a quick horror story for you.
 I was recently admin-ing one of my Linux servers. This server is the
company print server.
What had happened was a user was connected to a legacy system via a
terminal program.  Somewhere along the line there was a screwup and his
system starting dumping lots of extraneous data to the nearest printer. The
user tried to power-cycle the printer to no avail. Thankfully, they came to
me next to try and resolve the problem.

<P> Anyway, I ssh'd into the Linux box, changed to the 'spool/' directory and
did an 'ls' of the appropriate folder. After noting that there were a few
hundred print jobs waiting in the print queue I decided it was best if I
just deleted them all...

<P> Here is where the proverbial hit the spinning thing!

<P> ...I decided to 'rm -rf *' all the files. The problem is I did it from the
'spool/' directory rather than the proper printer directory. This had the
effect of deleting everything in my system spool directory!

<P> After realising my error I tried to fix it. First thing was trying "unrm".
This did not work as I could not read from the filesystem without errors.
Next I tried using a boot floppy and trying 'unrm' again. But no that would
not work because I could not get the RAID array to be recognised!!! Tried a
few other options until I gave up and decided it was time for an "upgrade".

<P> Problem solved after 3 hours    :)




<H2></H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:craigshelley@yahoo.com">Craig Shelley</A>

<P> After buying an all-on-board style PC and installing linux, I wanted to 
try out a dual-headed configuration. This was mainly because I found 
myself with a spare graphics card and monitor. I plugged in the new 
graphics card, and realised that the super complex modular BIOS system 
was automatically disabling interrupts from the on-board graphics 
system. According to the manual, it was impossible to turn off this 
'feature'. Then I had an idea!

<P> The idea was that if the new graphics card could be disabled while 
booting, the BIOS may ignore it. Then, I could re-enable the card for 
normal use.

<P> After studying the PCI bus pinout and specs, I decided to disconnect the 
reset line from the graphics card using a sharp screwdriver to destroy 
the track. I then re-connected the reset line through a switch, and then 
down to the ground connection. (Reset is Active Low)

<P> Using the switch I could disable the card, but it then became 
impossible to re-enable it because the PC could not reset it when it 
wanted to. I then decided to connect a resistor across the broken track 
so that the card could also be reset by the PC, and my switch would not 
affect anything else.

<P> The switch was neatly mounted on the metal back plate of the card, and 
can be switched when required.

<P> Using the switch, I put the card into reset mode, booted the PC, then 
turned the card back on, and found myself with two working monitors ;-) ;-)

<P> Also, have you ever wondered how to get out of the situation where X 
does not return VGA text mode? Adding one of these switches to your card 
solves this problem.

<EM>I finally have time (after a few years) to give back a little more to
the Linux community with the next in my series of articles on the Standard
C Library.&nbsp; I hope that you enjoy.</EM> </p>
       
<p>The <A HREF="../issue41/rogers.html">last article</A> was on &lt;assert.h&gt; 
diagnostics for programmers.&nbsp; 
  This article is on &lt;string.h&gt; string handling.&nbsp;&nbsp; C is not 
  much better at handling strings than machine code, so machine language programmers 
  will feel quite at home in this section.&nbsp; There are many limitations 
  and problems with string.h that will be addressed in the appropriate function 
  descriptions. </p>
       
<p>I am assuming a knowledge of C programming on the part of the reader.&nbsp; 
  There is no guarantee of accuracy in any of this information nor suitability 
  for any purpose. </p>
       
<p>The example is <a href="misc/rogers/rogers_example07.c">
    rogers_example07.c</a> .&nbsp; This is a basic example that will demonstrate
  each of the string functions.&nbsp; If you compile it and run it you will
  be able to see the output. &nbsp; Compare the output to the code and enjoy. 
  </p>
       
<p>As always, if you see an error in my documentation please tell me and I
will correct myself in a later document.&nbsp; See corrections at end of
  the document to review corrections to the previous articles. </p>
       
<p><b>WARNING:</b>&nbsp; Copying strings in C is the most dangerous part of
programming in C.&nbsp; C itself doesn't perform bounds checking, so it is
very easy to overwrite the end of a string and actually overwrite other variables
or even to crash the program.&nbsp; Crackers use this weakness in C and inexpert
coding practices to perform controlled overflows to force programs into giving
them a shell to the account that the program is running under.&nbsp; This
is usually root for most servers. </p>
       
<p>C doesn't really have strings.&nbsp; I know that is a strange thing to
  say in a document talking about string handling in C, but it is true.&nbsp; 
  What C does have is an array of characters.&nbsp; To make space for a string 
  you can ask the compiler to reserve room for that string.&nbsp; The most 
 common way is with a simple character array: </p>
       
<p><tt>char string[17];</tt> </p>
       
<p>This reserves room for 16 characters and an end-of-string marker. </p>
       
<p><tt>strcpy ( string, "This is a string" );</tt> </p>
       
<p>Will work to copy the static string "This is a string" into the space that
we allocated.&nbsp; The static string is composed of 16 characters followed
  by the ASCII nil character.&nbsp; So there is plenty of room in the variable
  called string to hold the static string.&nbsp; Nil is typically represented
  with the number zero or with the character '\0' or with the character '\000'. 
  </p>
       
<p>Surprisingly the following will sometimes work as well, even though there 
  are more then 17 characters copied into the char array: </p>
       
<p><tt>strcpy ( string, "This is a long string" );</tt> </p>
       
<p>There is never any bounds checking when you are copying strings.&nbsp; 
  So even though you went past the end of string and wrote to memory in an 
 unexpected way, most of the time you can get away with it.&nbsp; Of course 
 your program can also unexpectedly crash at anytime as well, sometimes in 
 a place far away from the place where you made your error.&nbsp; Crackers 
 can get a shell from the computer by overwriting the end of a buffer in such
 a way that the program executes a shell.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons 
 that you should really not use strcpy.&nbsp; Use strncpy instead: </p>
       
<p><tt>#define&nbsp; MAX_STRING_LENGTH&nbsp; 17</tt> <br>
    <tt>char string[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];</tt> <br>
    <tt>strncpy ( string, "This is a long string", MAX_STRING_LENGTH );</tt>
    <br>
    <tt>string[MAX_STRING_LENGTH-1] = '\000';</tt> </p>
       
<p>The reason that I used a macro for the string length is that I am using 
  this length in many places in my program, if I ever decide to change the 
 size of the variable string I would have to find everywhere where I used 
the number 17 and fix each one.&nbsp; Sometimes you may use the same number 
in different places to mean different things.&nbsp; So even if you only use 
a literal number in a few places using a macro can make the meaning of that 
 number really stand out and it makes it trivial to change the size of the 
 string buffer in this case. </p>
       
<p>The reason that I put the last line there is that if the literal string 
  is longer than the string that we are copying into then the end-of-string 
  marker isn't put into place.&nbsp; If you don't set the final character 
to null, most of the time you will be fine, but every once in a while your 
program will crash and you will wonder why. </p>
       
<p>There is also a third way to define a string and that is with malloc, realloc
and calloc.&nbsp; These functions work by requesting the memory that you
need at runtime.&nbsp; This is the most complicated but also the most flexible
and powerful. </p>
       
<p><tt>#define STATIC_STRING "This is a long string that will be copied into
  a location during runtime"</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>char *string;</tt> <br>
    <tt>int string_length;</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>string_length = strlen(STATIC_STRING);</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>if (!(string = (char *) malloc ( string_length ))){</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; /* no memory left, die */</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; exit (1);</tt> <br>
    <tt>}</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>strncpy( string,&nbsp; STATIC_STRING, string_length);</tt> <br>
    <tt>string[string_length] = '\000';</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>/* do something with the string */</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>free(string);</tt> </p>
       
<p> </p>
    One of the dangers of this method is that you have to clean up after
yourself,   using the free function. &nbsp;If you don't free everything when
you are  done with then you will be leaking memory and eventually your program
will  crash.<br>
       
<hr noshade>     
<p>The &lt;string.h&gt; library has numerous problems. </p>
       
<p>The biggest problem is that the library was never designed to be complete 
  and consistent.&nbsp; &lt;string.h&gt; really is a collection of functions 
  written by various people, assembled into a library and given to the world. 
  &nbsp; And now we are stuck with it. </p>
       
<p>Most of the functions can return a NULL or a pointer to a string.&nbsp; 
If a function <EM>can</EM> return a NULL, you should always check the return
value after calling it, and take appropriate action if it is NULL.&nbsp; If you 
attempt to treat a NULL return value as a pointer to a string, you will quickly 
crash your program. </p>
       
<p> </p>
       
<hr noshade>     
<p>I have arbitrarily grouped the functions into sections according to task,
to show the slight differences between similar functions.  One could also
group by string functions vs memory functions, but that seemed less useful.
</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Copying</font></b> </p>
       
<ul>
      <tt>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</tt>             
  <p><tt>void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);</tt> <br>
      <tt>void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);</tt> <br>
      <tt>char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);</tt> <br>
      <tt>char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);</tt> <br>
    &nbsp;</p>
       
</ul>
     <tt>void *dest</tt> is a pointer to the array which will receive the 
copy.   <br>
    <tt>char *dest</tt> is a pointer to the string which will receive the 
copy.   <br>
    <tt>const void *src</tt>&nbsp; is a pointer to the array from which the 
 copy will be made. <br>
    <tt>const char *src</tt> is a pointer to the string from which the copy 
 will be made. <br>
    <tt>size_t n </tt>is the number of characters to be copied.     
<p>These functions all return a pointer to dest.&nbsp; Which is strange, because
you already have a pointer to dest. </p>
       
<p><b>memcpy</b> copies n characters from the location pointed at by src to
the location pointed at by dest.&nbsp; Don't copy areas that overlap or your
program will crash. </p>
       
<p><b>memmove</b> also copies n characters from the location pointed at by
  src to the location pointed at by dest.&nbsp; But it first copies the characters
  to a temporary location then into the final location, so this is the function
  to use if you are copying overlapping areas of memory. </p>
       
<p><b>strncpy</b> copies no more than n characters from the location pointed 
  at by src to the location pointed at by dest.&nbsp; This function will stop
 at the first null character, which may be at any location less than or equal
 to n. If n characters are copied and no null is found, no null is written.&nbsp;
 This is a great way to leave the end of a string open.&nbsp; You should
always  explictly write zero to the end of the string. </p>
       
<p><b>strcpy</b> copies the string pointed at by src to the location pointed 
  at by dest, including the ending null character.&nbsp; <b>Warning! Never
  use this function for data that comes from the real world !!!&nbsp;</b>
&nbsp;   The biggest danger of using this function is that if there is no
null character   you will happily go copying through memory until you randomly
find a null   or you access memory that doesn't belong to your process and
the process  is killed with a SEGV (segfault) signal.&nbsp; Programs can capture this signal
and shutdown,   but at this point you are so hosed that it is best just to
let the program   core dump. </p>
       
<p>I have already given a few examples of how to use strcpy and strncpy.&nbsp; 
  memcpy and memmove are used exactly like strncpy, but they can copy arbitrary
  blocks of bytes, not just strings. </p>

      <tt>char *strncat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);</tt></p>
       
</ul>
     <tt>char *dest&nbsp;</tt> is a pointer to the string which will receive 
 the copy. <br>
    <tt>const char *src</tt>&nbsp; is a pointer to the string from which
the   copy will be made. <br>
    <tt>size_t n</tt>&nbsp; is the number of characters to be copied. <br>
    &nbsp;     
<p><b>strcat</b> appends the source string, including the final '\0', onto 
  the end of the destination string. It overwrites the trailing '\0' on the 
  end of the destination string. </p>
       
<p><b>strncat</b> does the same, except it will only copy at most n characters 
  from destination and it will append a '\0'. </p>
       
<p>Both <b>strcat </b>and <b>strncat</b> return a pointer to the destination 
  string. &nbsp;Again, there is no bounds checking on the resulting string,
  so make sure that the string you create isn't too long to fit in the memory
  you have allocated for it. </p>

    <tt>const void *s2</tt>&nbsp; is a pointer to the second memory array.

is less than s2, return a value less than zero.&nbsp; If s1 is equal to s2,
return zero.&nbsp; If s1 is greater than s2, return a value greater than
  zero.&nbsp; The comparison is based on the byte values of the ASCII characters
  in the memory array. </p>

</p>
       
<p><b>strncmp</b> is very similar to memcmp, except that it compares the two
strings, up to the length given by n.&nbsp; If a string is shorter than n,

  the first call the function is called with NULL as the first argument and 
  the function continues to return each token in turn until a NULL is returned 
  when there are no more tokens.&nbsp; The delimiter can be changed with each
 call, or can be kept the same through all the calls.&nbsp; The limitations

  The descriptions are taken out of the man pages cut and paste.&nbsp; If 
you want your code to work on any Unix box then don't use these functions.&nbsp; 
  However, they are a good guide for implementing a function in your own code
 that is portable. </p>
       
<p><tt>int strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);</tt> </p>
       
<p><b>strcasecmp</b> compares the two strings s1&nbsp; and s2,&nbsp; ignoring&nbsp; 
  the&nbsp; case of the characters.&nbsp; It returns an integer less than, 
 equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is found,&nbsp; respectively,&nbsp; 
to&nbsp; be&nbsp; less&nbsp; than, to match, or be greater than s2. </p>
       
<p><tt>int strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);</tt> </p>
       
<p><b>strncasecmp</b> is similar, except it only compares the first n characters 
  of s1. </p>
       
<p><b>strcasecmp </b>and&nbsp; <b>strncasecmp</b> return an integer less than,
equal to, or greater than&nbsp; zero&nbsp; if&nbsp; s1 (or&nbsp; the first
n bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be
greater than s2. </p>
       
<p><tt>char *strdup(const char *s);</tt> </p>
       
<p>I have implemented this function all on my own without knowing about this
  function!&nbsp; I learn something new about Linux everyday. </p>
       
<p><b>strdup</b> returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of
  the string s.&nbsp; Memory for the&nbsp; new string&nbsp; is&nbsp; obtained 
  with malloc(3), and can be freed with free(3). </p>
       
<p><b>strdup</b> returns a pointer to the&nbsp; duplicated string, or NULL 
  if insufficient memory was available. </p>
       
<p><tt>char *strfry(char *string);</tt> </p>
       
<p><b>strfry</b> randomizes the contents of string by using rand(3) to randomly
  swap characters in&nbsp; the&nbsp; string. The result is an anagram of
string.   </p>
       
<p><b>strfry</b> returns a pointer to the randomized string. </p>
       
<p><tt>char *strsep(char **stringp, const char *delim);</tt> </p>
       
<p><b>strsep</b>&nbsp; returns&nbsp; the&nbsp; next token from the string 
  stringp which is delimited by delim.&nbsp; The token&nbsp; is terminated 
 with a `\0' character and stringp is updated to point past the token.&nbsp; 
 Similar to the strtok() function, but is non-portable. </p>
       
<p><b>strsep</b> returns a pointer to the&nbsp; token,&nbsp; or NULL if delim
  is not found in stringp. </p>
       
<p><tt>char *index(const char *s, int c);</tt> </p>
       
<p><b>index</b> returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character 
  c in the string s.&nbsp; We should probably just use the strchr() function, 
  it performs the same function in a portable manner. </p>
       
<p><tt>char *rindex(const char *s, int c);</tt> </p>
       
<p><b>rindex</b> returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character 
  c in the string s.&nbsp; The terminating '\0' character is considered to 
 be a part of the strings.&nbsp; Please use the Standard C Library function 
 strrchr(), it performs the exact same function, in a portable manner. </p>
       
<p><b>index</b> and <b>rindex</b> return a pointer to the matched character 
  or NULL if the character is not found. </p>

<p>I didn't know snprintf, but I think that it is a clever thing to <br>
    do to avoid overflowing the string buffer (much better than the evil
<br>
    sprintf). </p>
       
<p>But that the first time I see it in a C library, so is-it a Linux only 
  <br>
    function or is-it a "new" standard function which wasn't included in
<br>
    HP-UX for example. </p>
       
<p>Maybe you could distinguish in your article, the standard library <br>
    function and those Linux only. </p>
       
<p>Anyway this snprintf function is "A good Thing" TM. </p>

    &nbsp; I think that it is a GNU only thing.&nbsp; So you may want to
avoid   using the snprintf function unless you only want your programs to
work in   a GNU environment.&nbsp; I found a bunch of very useful GNU only
string functions  and will taking your advice on pointing out those functions
that are only  found in Linux. <br>

<p>your code in Linux gazette is missing the setlocale() function call at
  the <br>
    beginning. That&acute;s why you don&acute;t get any <br>
    useful results for characters above 127 as programs start out in the

<a name="texinfo"></a>

<p>Texinfo is the documentation system preferred by GNU projects.</p>

<p>The major design goal of the Texinfo format is to produce high quality
printed output as well as online browsable output from the same source
(<em>.texi</em>) file. Texinfo obtains the basis for a high quality hardcopy
with a trick: it builds on plain TeX and adapts it by reading the
file&nbsp;<em>texinfo.tex</em> (Your system might have more than one copy of
this file. Check that you are really using a recent version (2002-01-04.07 as
of this writing)). <em>texinfo.tex</em> does all the necessary formatting
setup. It extends TeX to recognize hyper-references and all the gizmos that is
needed for online documentation. Rendered for online viewing, Texinfo source
yields Info (<em>.info</em>) files.</p>

<h3><a name="info what's that">Info? What's that?</a></h3>

<p>Info is an ASCII file format suitable for browsing hyperlinked documents.
It is intended to be portable to all platforms which run GNU applications.
Info focuses on textual data; this is, all Info files are viewable from a text
console. High resolution graphics are available only in printed output. Thus,
Info is the GNU counterpart of HTML minus some graphical extras. However, <a
href="#item_texi2html"><code>texi2html(1)</code></a> transforms Texinfo
sources (<em>.texi</em>) directly into HTML; see the section on <a href= 
"#browsers">Browsers</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="document structure">Document Structure</a></h3>

<p>Since Texinfo is based on TeX (see my second article in this series, 
"<a href= 
"../issue74/spiel.html">LaTeX with latex2html</a>"),
we expect to see again a header-body division. Also, the support for 
hyperlinks calls for additional structuring that we will meet in the form of
so-called nodes.</p>

<h4><a name="overall structure">Overall Structure</a></h4>

<p>Every Texinfo document starts by reading <em>texinfo.tex</em> with the
plain TeX command&nbsp;<code>\input</code>. This is about the only place where
plain TeX leaks into Texinfo. The part of the file from the inclusion of
<em>texinfo.tex</em> up to the so called Top node -- more on nodes later -- is
the document's header. The Top node opens up the body of the document, which
extends to the closing command&nbsp;<code>@bye</code>.</p>

<p>All Texinfo commands are introduced with an ``<code>@</code>''-character.
The at-character is followed by one or more letters. Only a few commands require
curly braces to group together their arguments. We have already encountered
the end-of-document command&nbsp;<code>@bye</code>. The following example of a
minimal Texinfo file introduces the comment command, which is <code>@c</code>.
Texinfo comments extend to the end of the line in which they are given.</p>

<blockquote><code>\input texinfo<br>
<br>
<br>
@c === header ===<br>
...<br>
<br>
<br>
@c === body ===<br>
<br>
@c --- Top Node ---<br>
...<br>
<br>
@c --- Sub Nodes ---<br>
...<br>
<br>
<br>
@bye</code></blockquote>

<h4><a name="header">Header</a></h4>

<p>The header of a Texinfo file is optional, but it appears in all documents.
It at least contains the name of the online-reading output file, and the title
used in the printed output.</p>

<p>The output filename is set with the command <code>@setfilename</code>
<em>output-filename</em>. I recommend adding the extension <em>.info</em> to
<em>output-filename</em>, because files without an extension are harder to access
with common shell tools--just think of <code>ls *.info</code>! The argument of
<code>@setfilename</code> reaches right to the end of the line, thus you
cannot add a comment after setting the output filename. Bummer!</p>

<p>Set the document title with
<code>@settitle</code>&nbsp;<em>document-title</em>. Again, the argument
stretches until the end of the line. The title -- as defined by
<code>@settitle</code> -- is used for page headers or footers in the printed
output. It has nothing to do with the document title used on the title page
(if a title page exists at all).</p>

<p>Thus, a simple header looks like this:</p>

<pre>
    @setfilename example.info
    @settitle Texinfo Example
</pre>

<p>Other useful commands in the header are:</p>

<ul>
<li>@afourpaper and @afourwide 

<p>By default Texinfo assumes a paper size of 8.5"&nbsp;by&nbsp;11". Outside
Northern America, paper sizes are chosen according to DIN (DIN is the
abbreviation for ``Deutsche Industrie Norm'', ``German Industry Standard'' in
English). The commands&nbsp;<code>@afourpaper</code> and
<code>@afourwide</code> adjust the printable area for sheets of size
DIN&nbsp;A4, where <code>@afourwide</code> selects a somewhat larger printable
area; it does not switch to landscape.</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> It is a good plan to inspect the paper size settings of any
foreign Texinfo document before you send it to the printer.</p>
</li>

<li>@setchapternewpage on | off | odd 

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_on">on</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Start a new page for each chapter. Format page headers and footers for
single-sided printing. This is the default setting.</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_off">off</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Do not start a new page for a new chapter; just insert some white space
before the new chapter. Format page headers and footers for single-sided
printing.</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_odd">odd</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Start new chapters on odd-numbered pages. Format page headers and footers
for double-sided (``recto verso'') printing.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that no <code>@setchapternewpage&nbsp;even</code>&nbsp;command is
defined.</p>
</li>

<li>@paragraphindent asis | <em>number</em> 

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_asis">asis</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Do not change indentation</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_number"><em>number</em></a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Indent the first line of each paragraph by <em>number</em>&nbsp;spaces,
where <em>number</em> can be zero.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: All GNU development projects ship with documentation in Texinfo
format. If you want to print the documentation on your local output device, it
is a good plan to modify the header of the Texinfo files to match your paper
size (Letter, A4) and printing equipment (duplex unit, and so on).</p>

<h4><a name="body">Body</a></h4>

<p>The body of a Texinfo document is a mixture of sectioning commands for
printing (the TeX part: chapters, sections, sub-sections, and so on) and
grouping commands for online viewing (the Info part: nodes). In theory both
parts can impose different structures on the document, however this would
seriously confuse readers -- probably not what you want when writing technical
documentation.</p>

<p>I will present a simplified way of writing the body, where the structure of
the online version and of the printed version closely go together. This saves
the writer the headaches of manually setting up the structure for the online
version at the price of sacrificing some additional navigation possibilities.
The simplified way requires pairing the Info structure information with that
of the printed version.</p>

<p>The Info structure is defined with
<code>@node</code>&nbsp;<em>node-name</em>&nbsp;commands, whereas the printed
structure is given -- among others -- with the
commands&nbsp;<code>@chapter</code>&nbsp;<em>chapter-title</em>,
<code>@section</code> <em>section-title</em>, and
<code>@subsection</code>&nbsp;<em>subsection-title</em>. The
<code>@node</code>&nbsp;command always goes first. So we get, for example,</p>

<pre>
    @node Introduction
    @chapter Introduction
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
    @node Iterative-Processes
    @section Iterative Processes
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
    @node Numerical Stability
    @subsection Numerical Stability of Iterative Algorithms
</pre>

<p>The argument to <code>@node</code>, assigns the
name&nbsp;<em>node-name</em> to the node. The name consists of one or more
words. Spaces are perfectly valid in <em>node-name</em>, but
periods&nbsp;``<code>.</code>'', commas&nbsp;``<code>,</code>'',
colons&nbsp;``<code>:</code>'', and apostrophes&nbsp;``<code>'</code>'' are
not. It is also better to avoid commands (anything starting with
``<code>@</code>'') in a node name. Case of node-names is significant. Within
a Texinfo document each node must have a unique name. By convention, node
names are capitalized just as chapter or section titles are.</p>

<p>A node either contains only data (this is, text, tables, images, and
cross-references), or a node defines a navigation menu. I call the former a
Terminal&nbsp;Nodes and the latter a Menu&nbsp;Nodes.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_Terminal_Node">Terminal Node</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>The structure of a Terminal&nbsp;Node is 

<blockquote><code>@node</code> <var>node-name</var><br>
<code>@section</code> <var>section-title</var><br>
<br>
<var>text-for-node-and-chapter</var></blockquote>

<p>where I use <code>@section</code> as an example for a sectioning
command.</p>

<p>Terminal&nbsp;Nodes are the ``meat'' of a document. They hold all the
visible information. <em>text-for-node-and-chapter</em> usually consists of
one or more paragraphs, tables, and so on.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_Menu_Node">Menu Node</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Menu nodes provide decentralized tables of contents, this is meta
information, from which you can jump to any of the topics referred to in the
menu. 

<p>The structure of a Menu&nbsp;Node is the same as for a Terminal&nbsp;Node,
with the exception that a Menu&nbsp;Node is ended by the definition of a
navigation menu. The navigation menu only goes into the Info version, never
into the printed one.</p>

<blockquote><code>@node</code> <var>node-name</var><br>
<code>@chapter</code> <var>chapter-title</var><br>
<br>
<var>optional-introductory-text-for-node-and-chapter</var><br>
<br>
<code>@menu</code><br>
 <code>*</code> <var>Node name of first section</var><code>::</code>
<var>Synopsis of first section</var><br>
<code>*</code> <var>Node name of second section</var><code>::</code>
<var>Synopsis of second section</var><br>
...<br>
<code>*</code> <var>Node name of last section</var><code>::</code>
<var>Synopsis of last section</var><br>
<code>@end menu</code></blockquote>

<p>A navigation menu is bracketed by</p>

<blockquote><code>@menu</code><br>
<br>
<code>@end menu</code></blockquote>

<p>where every line in between makes up one menu entry. Each menu entry starts
with an asterisk&nbsp;``<code>*</code>'' followed by the name of the node it
points to (the target node's name). It is ended by two colons
``<code>::</code>'' and an optional short description of the target:</p>

<p><code>*</code> <em>Target Node Name</em><code>::</code> <em>Optional
description of target node</em></p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_Top_Node">Top Node</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>One menu node in every Texinfo document plays a special role: the master
menu node from which the rest of the document is accessed. This root node is
called <code>Top</code>&nbsp;node; we define it with the pair 

<blockquote><code>@node Top</code><br>
<code>@top</code> <var>name-of-top-node</var></blockquote>

<p>As the Top node will appear first whenever the online version is browsed
(unless you explicitly specify a node to start browsing with), you want to
have some introductory text to go with it. This introduction often is not
suited for the printed version. The printed version shows no menus at all,
remember? Thus, we want to exclude the introductory text from the printed
version, which is done with the <a href=
"#conditional_translation">conditional translation</a> command pair
<code>@ifinfo</code> and <code>@end ifinfo</code>. A simple Top node then
looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><code>@ifinfo</code><br>
<code>@node</code> Top<br>
<code>@top</code> Example<br>
This is an example Texinfo document.<br>
<br>
<code>@end ifinfo</code><br>
<br>
<code>@menu</code><br>
<code>*</code> Name of first chapter<code>::</code> Synopsis of first
chapter<br>
<code>*</code> Name of second chapter<code>::</code> Synopsis of second
chapter<br>
<code>*</code> Name of third chapter<code>::</code> Synopsis of third

<code>@end menu</code></blockquote>

<h3><a name="syntax">Syntax</a></h3>

<p>As we have already seen, Texinfo commands start with an at-sign
``<code>@</code>''. The at-sign is either followed by a single non-letter
character or one or more characters. Some commands of the first group
include</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_%40%40"><code>@@</code></a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Insert a literal at-sign&nbsp;(``<code>@</code>'').</dd>

<dt><strong><a name=
"item_%40%22character"><code>@"</code><em>character</em></a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Typeset the umlaut equivalent of <em>character</em>, where
<em>character</em> is a single ASCII character like, for example, ``a''. The
same holds for accented (<code>@'</code><em>character</em>), circumflexed
(<code>@^</code><em>character</em>), or cedilla decorated
(<code>@,</code><em>character</em>) characters. See node
``Inserting&nbsp;Accents'' in the Texinfo documentation for details.</dd>
</dl>

<p>and some in the latter group are</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_%40contents">@contents</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Insert the table of contents where @contents occurs.</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_%40page">@page</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Start a new page.</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_%40findex_function%2Dname">@findex
<em>function-name</em></a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Generate an index entry for <em>function-name</em> in the index of all
functions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Depending on the command, no argument, one argument, or more than one
argument may be required. Some commands require their arguments to be enclosed
on curly braces, like cross references,
<code>@xref{</code><em>node-name</em><code>,</code>
<em>cross-reference-name</em><code>,</code>
<em>title-or-topic</em><code>}</code>. We have seen commands which take rest
of the line as their arguments (for example <code>@setfilename</code>).</p>

<h3><a name="sectioning">Sectioning</a></h3>

<p>As with TeX, we just type text, separating paragraphs with blank lines.
Paragraphs will be filled or even justified depending on the used translation
tools.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;<a>Body</a> has introduced the main sectioning commands.
<code>@node</code> groups the input together in chunks for online reading. An
accompanying TeX-like sectioning command does the same for the printed output.
In particular Texinfo offers the following sectioning commands:
<code>chapter</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>subsection</code>, and
<code>subsubsection</code>.</p>

<p>Please remember that -- for a simplified node management -- each
<code>@node</code> must be followed by one of the sectioning commands for the
printed version.</p>

<h3><a name="title page">Title Page</a></h3>

<p>Making a decent title page is easy. The
<code>@titlepage</code>&nbsp;command with its sub-commands
<code>@title</code>, <code>@subtitle</code> (optional), and
<code>@author</code> completely takes care of the layout. If you want the
material after the title to go on an odd page add a page
break&nbsp;<a><code>@page</code></a> right before
<code>@end&nbsp;titlepage</code>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
    @titlepage
    @title A Texinfo Example Document
    @subtitle Playing With the Texinfo Format
    @author Joanne H. Acker
    @page @c -- force odd page
    @end titlepage
</pre>

<h3><a name="conditional_translation">Conditional Translation</a></h3>

<p>In the section on the <a href="#item_Top_Node">Top Node</a>, we encountered the
condition translation
command&nbsp;<code>@ifinfo</code>/<code>@end&nbsp;info</code>. Conditional
translation means directing parts of a document to one translator only, or, in
the negated form <code>@ifnotinfo</code>/<code>@end notinfo</code>, excluding
one translator (makeinfo in our example) from processing a chunk of the
document.</p>

<p>The opening (<code>@if</code><em>format</em>) and closing sequence
(<code>@end</code> <em>format</em>) should appear on lines by themselves.</p>

<p>Three conditionals are available in positive and negative form for
diverting data to or away from Info, TeX and HTML.</p>

<pre>
    @iftex
    ...
    @end tex
</pre>

<pre>
    @ifinfo
    ...
    @end info
</pre>

<pre>
    @ifhtml
    ...
    @end html
</pre>

<pre>
    @ifnottex
    ...
    @end nottex
</pre>

<pre>
    @ifnotinfo
    ...
    @end notinfo
</pre>

<pre>
    @ifnothtml
    ...
    @end nothtml
</pre>

<h3><a name="lists">Lists</a></h3>

<p>Texinfo features the fundamental types of lists, which any author expects:
itemized and enumerated lists. Description lists are written in terms of
tables.</p>

<p>All lists nest.</p>

<p>Command&nbsp;<code>@item</code> starts an entry in a list or table. The
entry can comprise several paragraphs or further lists. Did I tell you that
all lists nest? They do!</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_Itemized_Lists">Itemized Lists</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>
<blockquote><code>@itemize</code> <var>glyph</var><br>
<code>@item</code> <var>Text for first item</var><br>
<code>@item</code> <var>Text for second item</var><br>
...<br>
<code>@item</code> <var>Text for last item</var><br>
<code>@end itemize</code></blockquote>

<p>Symbol&nbsp;<em>glyph</em> will be put in front of every item. Useful
values for <em>glyph</em> are <code>@bullet</code>, <code>@minus</code>, and
<code>*</code>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_Enumerated_Lists">Enumerated Lists</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>
<blockquote><code>@enumerate</code> <var>counter-selector</var><br>
<code>@item</code> <var>Text for first item</var><br>
<code>@item</code> <var>Text for second item</var><br>
...<br>
<code>@item</code> <var>Text for last item</var><br>
<code>@end enumerate</code></blockquote>

<p><em>counter-selector</em> selects the type of counter (numeral or letter)
and the starting value. If <em>counter-selector</em> is omitted, the list will
be decorated with Arabic numerals starting at one.</p>

<p>A positive integer value for <em>counter-selector</em> starts the list at
the given value. This is useful when continuing a list. An uppercase or
lowercase letter for <em>counter-selector</em> selects letters for the
enumeration; again, the list starts with the given letter.</p>

<p>Texinfo cannot render enumerate lists with Roman numerals.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_Description_Lists">Description
Lists</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>I have mentioned that Texinfo does not offer native description lists, but
emulates typesetting them with two-column tables. So, we get the following
syntax for description lists: 

<blockquote><code>@table</code> <var>format-selector</var><br>
<code>@item</code> <var>First term</var><br>
<var>Description for first item</var><br>
<code>@item</code> <var>Second term</var><br>
<var>Description for second item</var><br>
...<br>
<code>@item</code> <var>Last term</var><br>
<var>Description for last item</var><br>
<code>@end table</code></blockquote>

<p><em>format-selector</em> determines how the terms are typeset. For no added
markup, this is, plain description lists, use <code>@asis</code> as
<em>format-selector</em>. If you have code, sample input or output, variables,
or keystrokes as terms, use <code>@code</code>, <code>@samp</code>,
<code>@var</code>, or <code>@kbd</code> respectively. See
section&nbsp;<a>Inline&nbsp;Markup</a> for how to markup specific items.</p>

<p>Within a table, the argument to <code>@item</code> is all the text from
<code>@item</code> to the end of the line. Note that this is different from
itemized and enumerated lists! Thus, the term in a "description list" can only
be a single line. The text after the <code>@item</code>-line up to the next
<code>@item</code> or the end of the table becomes the term's description. The
description can be several paragraphs long and it can contain other lists, and
so on.</p>

<p>Sometimes we need additional terms on separate lines. Because
<code>@item</code> puts its argument on a single lines, another command is
required: <code>@itemx</code> places an additional term right below an
existing term. <code>@itemx</code> is only valid directly after an
<code>@item</code>&nbsp;command or <code>@itemx</code>&nbsp;command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="crossreferences">Cross-References</a></h3>

<p>Texinfo supports a variety of cross reference types: with or without
additional text, within the same file, across different Texinfo files, and to
the outside world.</p>

<p>Nodes are the primary targets of cross references.
<code>@anchor{</code><em>anchor-name</em><code>}</code> marks additional
targets. Command <code>@anchor</code> does not produce any output. The names
of anchors must not conflict with node names.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_%40xref">@xref</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Insert a decorated cross reference. @xref formats the decoration for the
start of a sentence. 

<p>Example usage:</p>

<pre>
    ... is the basis for several multi-point
    methods.  @xref{Multi-point Methods}.  We
    study the single point method ...
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_%40pxref">@pxref</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>@pxref behaves like @xref, but it is meant to be used inside parenthesis. 

<p>Example usage:</p>

<pre>
    The algorithm fails at higher order
    roots (@pxref{Higher Order Root}) and
    ill-conditioned roots of order one.
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_%40ref">@ref</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Inserts an undecorated cross reference. Otherwise it behaves like
@xref.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Until now we have only used the one-argument form of the cross referencing
commands. However, they accept up to five parameters. Here is how the output
changes with the number of parameters. I demonstrate the flexible usage with
@xref.</p>

<dl>

<h3><a name="inline markup">Inline Markup</a></h3>

<p>Texinfo defines a whole bunch of commands to markup special parts of text
as being code, input from the user, a filename, and so on.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@emph{</code><em>text-in-italics</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Render <em>text-in-italics</em> in italics. Info approximates italicization
with underscores that bracket <em>text-in-italics</em>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
    Use tex(1), @emph{not} latex(1) to process
    your Texinfo files.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@strong{</code><em>bold-text</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Render <em>bold-text</em> in boldface. Info approximates boldface with
asterisks that bracket <em>bold-text</em>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
    Info files @strong{cannot} contain high
    resolution graphics.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@file{</code><em>filename</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Make <em>filename</em> stand out by surrounding it with single quotes, like
<code>`filename'</code>. The printer version typesets <em>filename</em> in
typewriter font.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
    Ensure the latest version of
    @file{texinfo.tex} is installed on your Linux box.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@url{</code><em>universal-resource-locator</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Identify a universal resource locator (URL). The online version will show
angle brackets around <em>universal-resource-locator</em>. The printed version
does not add angle brackets, but typesets <em>universal-resource-locator</em>
in typewriter font.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
    More information on Texinfo can be
    found at @url{<a href="http://texinfo.org/">http://texinfo.org/</a>}.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@code{</code><em>program-code</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Mark up short pieces of program code.</p>

<pre>
    Prefer the two-argument form of
    @code{bless}, this is, always write
    @code{bless $objref, $class}.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@samp{</code><em>literal-text</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Mark up literal characters, literal text, symbol names, and so on.</p>

<pre>
    Angle brackets (@samp{&lt;}, @samp{&gt;}) are the
    main delimiters used in HTML.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@var{</code><em>replaceable-item</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Mark up meta-syntactic variables, the famous <code>foo</code> and
<code>bar</code>.</p>

<pre>
    The Perl command @code{bless} is best called
    with two arguments, like @code{bless
    @var{object_reference}, @var{classname}}.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@kbd{</code><em>keystrokes</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Mark up a single keystroke or a series of keystrokes.</p>

<pre>
    Within emacs, type @kbd{C-h i} to start the
    built-in Info browser, or type @kbd{M-x
    info}.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@command{</code><em>command-name</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Mark up a command name.</p>

<pre>
    The two most important shell commands are
    @command{ls} and @command{cd}.
</pre>
</li>

<li><code>@option{</code><em>option-name</em><code>}</code> 

<p>Mark up an option name. Use <code>@option</code> in running text like</p>

<pre>
    Option @option{--html} forces
    @command{makeinfo} to generate HTML output
    instead of Info.
</pre>

<p><code>@option</code> is not suited for marking up a command's synopsis. To
mark up a synopsis use the <code>@example</code>-environment. Say</p>

<pre>
    @example
        makeinfo --html --output=@var{output-filename} @var{input-filename}
    @end example
</pre>

<p>and refer to the options in the running text with
<code>@option{--html}</code> and <code>@option{--output}</code>, as well as to
the arguments <code>@var{output-filename}</code> and
<code>@var{input-filename}</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</dt>

<dd>makeinfo transforms Texinfo files&nbsp;(<em>.texi</em>) into 

<ol>
<li>Info 

<p>By default, makeinfo generates Info files with the filename selected by
<code>@setfilename</code>. Option&nbsp;<code>--no-split</code> prevents
makeinfo from breaking the output in chunks (approximately 50KB in size).</p>

<p>Processing a Texinfo file with makeinfo also thoroughly validates the input
file.</p>
</li>

<li>Plain ASCII 

<p>Option&nbsp;<code>--no-headers</code> makes makeinfo generate plain ASCII
files. Plain ASCII is a useful format for proofreading the online version and
also for applying spelling checkers like, for example, diction(1).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_texi2html">texi2html</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>As you might have guessed from the command's name, texi2html transforms
Texinfo into HTML. Option&nbsp;<code>-monolithic</code> forces the output of a
single file. Option&nbsp;<code>-split</code> on the other hand forces one file
per node. 

<p>texi2html by default converts <code>@iftex</code>&nbsp;sections and not
<code>@ifinfo</code> ones. You can reverse this behavior with the
<code>-expandinfo</code>&nbsp;option.</p>

<p>Note that all of texi2html's options start with a single dash.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_texi2dvi">texi2dvi</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>Produce a device independent file&nbsp;<em>.dvi</em> form Texinfo source.
To get Postscript, apply <code>dvips(1)</code> to the <em>.dvi</em>&nbsp;file.
I have found the options <code>--clean</code> and <code>--quiet</code> useful.
The first removes all intermediate files, leaving only the final
<em>.dvi</em>&nbsp;file. The second suppresses all non-essential messages
(``No gnews is good gnews!'').</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_texi2pdf">texi2pdf</a></strong><br>
</dt>

<dd>texi2pdf makes a Portable Document File&nbsp;(<em>.pdf</em>) from Texinfo
source in one shot. It accepts the same options as texi2dvi does. However, I
found, it definitely wants to see option&nbsp;<code>--pdf</code> or it stops,
crying for a <em>.dvi</em>&nbsp;file even if this very file exists. Argh! So,
my typical calls are 

<pre>
    texi2pdf --quiet --clean --pdf foobar.texi

<h3><a name="browsers">Browsers</a></h3>

<p>Texinfo differs from all the document preparation systems that we have had
a look at so far, for Texinfo can be translated in an online viewing format
different from HTML, namely: Info. Having an online viewing format, we need
browsers to actually view it!</p>

<p><code>info</code>, the mother of all Info browsers, is a simple but

files</a> at a console.</p>

<p>To view the Info pages of <em>topic</em>, use</p>

<pre>
    info topic
</pre>

<p>To browse Info file&nbsp;<em>info-file</em>, add
<code>--file=</code><em>info-file</em> to the invocation of info, where
<em>info-file</em> contains the complete path to the Info file.</p>

<p>If you would like to start browsing at specific
node&nbsp;<em>node-name</em>, add <code>--node=</code><em>node-name</em>.</p>

<p>My favorite mistake is mixing up <em>topic</em> with <em>info-file</em>,
this is saying</p>

<pre>

do!</em></blockquote>

<p>You browse the installed Info documents (`<code>C-h i</code>', <a href= 
"#item_info"><code>info</code></a>). Or you load an Info file into Emacs and
turn the buffer an Info-browser with <code>Info-on-current-buffer</code> (note
the capital "I"). If you dislike switching between the Info buffer and you
working buffers, open the file to browse in another frame (`<code>C-x 5
f</code>', <code>find-file-other-frame</code>). To open a new frame with an
Info browser in it, switch to the <code>*info*</code>&nbsp;buffer in your
current emacs and issue <code>view-buffer-other-frame</code>.</p>

<dd>xinfo is an ancient Info browser for the use under X11. It does not do any
colorization. What bothers me most about xinfo -- to the degree that I refuse to
use this browser -- is the separation of navigation hot spots and display.
This means you have to click in the topmost pane to navigate a menu shown in
the second pane. Clicking directly on the menu item in the second pane has no
effect.

What is the difference between a bridging firewall and a conventional firewall?
Usually a firewall also acts as a router: systems on the inside are configured
to see the firewall as a gateway to the network outside, and routers outside
are configured to see the firewall as the gateway to the protected network. A
bridge is piece of equipment that connects two (or more) network segments
together and passes packets back and forth without the rest of the network
being aware of its existence.  In other words, a router connects two networks
together and translates between them; a bridge is like a patch cable,
connecting two portions of one network together.  A bridging firewall acts as a
bridge but also filters the packets it passes, while remaining unseen by either
side.<p>

Why might you want to so such a thing? A couple of reasons spring to mind:<p>

<ul>
<li>You can plug in a firewall without changing any of your existing network software configuration.
<li>You may want to protect part of a network where you do not have control of the external routing into your network.
</ul>

<h2>My Problem</h2>

In my office I had a shiny new ADSL connection from Demon Internet
with an assigned 16 address subnet (less base, broadcast and router IP
= 13 IP addresses). Because of the vagaries of the UK commercial and
regulatory environment, the line and router were installed and owned by
British Telecom plc. and there was no facility to configure the router
to use an internal gateway.  This left me two choices:

<ul>
<li>Connect every host directly to the ADSL router and set up iptables separately for each one.
<li>Use a firewall with ip masquerading to present a single ip address to the outside world.
</ul>

The first was untenable.  Multiplying the number of iptable configurations
multiplied the chances of error and the administration overhead.
The second had its own drawbacks. While most things can be set up to
work quite happily with IP masquerading, there are exceptions, including
some technologies that I wished to explore, such as VPNs. A bridging
firewall would solve this problem. The firewall could stand between the
ADSL router and the rest of the router and protect the network without
reconfiguring the router. The one remaining obstacle was that the bridging
code in the standard Linux kernel completely bypasses iptables, so you
can have a box which is either a bridge, or a firewall, but not both.

<h2>The Solution</h2>

Fortunately, there is a <a href="http://bridge.sourceforge.net">project</a>
to implement bridging in conjunction with iptables, so that any packets
transmitted across the bridge can be subject to iptables rules. The
result is a firewall that can be totally transparent to the network,
requiring no special routing. As far as the Internet is concerned, the
firewall does not exist, except that certain connections are blocked. The
bridge software is a kernel patch to allow the existing bridge code to
work inside iptables. Conveniently, the developers have made available
a Redhat 7.2 kernel rpm with the patch installed. Less conveniently,
documentation on how to use it is minimal, so I thought to document this
implementation as an aid to anyone else following the same path.<p>

<h2>Bridging and Routing - how it works</h2>

Briefly. the linux bridge implementation works by tying together two
or more network interfaces. By monitoring activity on all the attached
network segments the bridge code learns which MAC addresses are accessible
from each interface and uses this information to decide which packets to
send out on each interface. The interfaces attached to the bridge to not
normally have an IP address associated with them, but the entire bridge
is configured as a single interface to the firewall.

<img src="misc/whitmarsh/flows.png" alt="packet flows within the firewall"><p>

<h2>Network topology</h2>

My allocated static IP addresses are in the range xxx.xxx.xxx.48-63,
i.e. a subnet mask of 255.255.255.240. I decided to split this range
into two network segments,xx.xxx.xxx.48-56 would be used outside the
firewall, and this includes the IP address of the ADSL router itself
(xxx.xxx.xxx.49). xxx.xxx.xxx.57-62 would be the secure section behind
the firewall. Note that these are not truly subnets as they are linked
by a bridge rather than a router.<p>

<img src="misc/whitmarsh/network.png" alt="network topology"><p>

<h2>Firewall Rules</h2>

The <a href="misc/whitmarsh/rc.firewall.sh.txt">sample firewall script</a>
is broadly similar to a conventional firewall setup (cribbed from 
<a href="http://www.boingworld.com/workshops/linux/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html">
Oskar Andreasson's iptables tutorial</a>. The basic firewall policy is:

<ol>
<li>Block packets from unlikely IP addresses
<li>Allow any outgoing connections from behind the firewall
<li>Allow packets in that belong to established connections
<li>Allow connections to specified ports and hosts from outside
</ol>

<h3>Variable definitions</h3>

For clarity and maintainability it is a good idea to keep interface names
and IP addresses as variables. The values used for these examples are:<p>

<pre>
BR_IP="xxx.xxx.xxx.57"
BR_IFACE=br0

LAN_BCAST_ADDRESS="xxx.xxx.xxx.63"
INTERNAL_ADDRESS_RANGE="xxx.xxx.xxx.56/29"

INET_IFACE="eth1"
LAN_IFACE="eth0"

LO_IFACE="lo"
LO_IP="127.0.0.1"
</pre>

"xxx.xxx.xxx" represents the first three bytes of the network IP
addresses. $INTERNAL_ADDRESS_RANGE is the secure network segment.<p>

<h3>Setting up the bridge</h3>

We have to do a some less conventional things to set up the bridge. First
we shut down our two interfaces and remove any IP address from them.<p>

<pre>
ifdown $INET_IFACE
ifdown $LAN_IFACE
ifconfig $INET_IFACE 0.0.0.0
ifconfig $LAN_IFACE 0.0.0.0
</pre>

If you just executed these commands from a telnet connection (or ssh
as you are so security conscious), get up and cross the room to your
firewall's console.<p>

Next we create a bridge and assign the Ethernet interfaces to it.<p>
<pre>
brctl addbr $BR_IFACE

brctl addif $BR_IFACE $INET_IFACE
brctl addif $BR_IFACE $LAN_IFACE
</pre>

You can now bring up the bridge as an internal interface if you wish:

<pre>
ifconfig $BR_IFACE $BR_IP
</pre>

<h3>Blocking spoofs</h3>

We can block spoofed packets in the mangle PREROUTING chain. By blocking
here we can catch both INPUT and FORWARDED packets at the same time. We
use mangle PREROUTING rather than nat PREROUTING because only the first
packet of each stream is checked in the nat table.<p>

This line ensures that only packets with valid internal addresses are
accepted on the internal interface.<p>

<pre>
$IPTABLES -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i $LAN_IFACE -s $INTERNAL_ADDRESS_RANGE -j ACCEPT
</pre>

And this prevents packets with internal addresses being accepted on the
external interface:<p>

<pre>
$IPTABLES -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i $INET_IFACE ! -s $INTERNAL_ADDRESS_RANGE -j ACCEPT
</pre>

<h3>Accessing the firewall from the internal network</h3>

You may choose to leave your firewall completely invisible to the network,
or you may wish for convenience to allow connections from within.  
These commands will allow all connections to the firewall from the
internal network only. You may wish to be more selective depending on
your level of trust of your network systems and users.<p>

<pre>
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -p ALL -i $BR_IFACE -s $INTERNAL_ADDRESS_RANGE -d $LAN_BCAST_ADDRESS -j ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -p ALL -i $BR_IFACE -s $INTERNAL_ADDRESS_RANGE -d $BR_IP -j ACCEPT
</pre>

Remember that we have already eliminated packets that claim to be from
$INTERNAL_ADDRESS_RANGE that appear on the wrong interface.<p>

Diving into dry pools head-first is a good start, particularly from the
high board - it's been known to cure incipient crackers. Sure, some - well,
most - end up looking like a squashed bug, but you've got to admit, it's
much better than the alternative. Be sure to try it today!

<P> For advanced hacking skills, take a look at Eric S. Raymond's "How To Become A
Hacker", at 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</A>. That takes you
all the way from beginner to advanced... not what you meant? Oh, right, I
forgot; when the cracker maggots invade your brain, language skills are the
first thing to go. &lt;shrug&gt; I guess you'll never be able to explain what you
really want, now. I understand that progression of the disease is difficult to
reverse, deterioration is rapid, and the prognosis is NOT positive.

<P> A friend of mine's got a 10th floor apartment, and the pool might even have
been emptied for the winter. Want me to ask? Really, it wouldn't take long
at all...

<P> Regarding MSN, Good news!!! I've got a *great* cracking opportunity coming up for you;
you'll need to break into MSN and establish a new account. See, you'll
*have* to do this because I'm about to report your criminal activities to
MSN - including your confession of having already "done a few hacks with
some trojan programs", so that even their admin people can have a laugh at
your terminally moronic behavior. All they have to do is look at the
headers in your e-mail (didn't know about those, did you?), compare them
with the copy that will still be on their servers (missed that one too,
huh?), and TOSs your ass so hard that you'll bounce.

<P> You know, if you ask the folks at your local TV or radio station, they
might let you climb their tower - you could get a coupla hundred feet up
that way - and you could always drag up a bathtub. Seriously, give it a
shot: it can't hurt. Well, actually it would, but it's the kind of thing
you're supposed to say...

<P>
I've got to give MSN their due: they actually have humans assigned to
dealing with this stuff, and when these folks LART one, they let you know:
"Hi, my name is X, and I'm the one assigned to this case. I've examined the
information you've sent us, and terminated our former customer on that
basis. Thank you for...", etc. They also seem to pay attention to the info
that you send them in the complaint letter. My "spamkill" file contains
quite a few from them.

That might refer to Linus' original comment that penguins are happy 
because they have just stuffed themselves full of herring or have been 
hanging out with lady penguins. We only <EM>know</EM> that Tux is stuffed full 
of herring, but we can assume Tux hangs out with lady penguins.

<P>
Which actually doesn't get say definitively whether Tux is male. Tux 
could hang out with lady penguins cf. Marlena Dietrich, or be a 
high-class drag king.

<P> However, speaking as a dyke with a largish stuffed animal collection 
(one of whom is a female Peter Rabbit named Katja), my Tux is male. Other

their kernel configurations.

Down with $3 words!  It's ridiculous that children compete in spelling
bees over words that ordinary people would never use and don't know exist.  
Just because it's *possible* to derive a fancy Latin word for an ordinary
English word doesn't automatically make it an English word.  It's academickese,
not English.  There's probably a simple English word or circumlocution that
covers the same terrain perfectly adequately, so why not use it?  There's
nothing to be gained by using words Joe Sixpack can't understand, except for
the "few" technical terms that are absolutely necessary for a given field.


<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

<P>
I disagree, almost entirely.
It depends, of course, on what your *objective* is, and there are many
objectives in writing: you might be trying to impress people, to inform
them, to persuade them... 
Each of these jobs requires a different set of tools, just as there
is no one answer to the question "what kind of computer should I buy"
other than "well, what are you going to *do* with it?"

<P> Certainly, it's possible to use words which are fancier-than-thou, and
lose your audience in the process.  But that possibility isn't by any
means justification for not being literate and -- dare I say it --
lyrical in your writing.

<P> But, contrary to many people's belief, I think that people want to read
elegant writing, even if it occasionally makes them need to look up a
word that they can't glark from context.  


<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Iron]

<P>
True, there is language-for-communication and language-as-art.  I would
argue that academic/techical writing is supposedly language-for-communication, 
thus, its tendency to fanciness hinders its basic purpose.  

<P> An urgent example in US society is the language of laws.  Nobody but lawyers
can understand then, and even lawyers don't agree on what the DMCA means.  How
are people supposed to obey laws they can't understand and don't have time to
read?  How can they evaluate whether the law is just?  How can they avoid being
hoodwinked?

<P> Personal writing-as-art is a personal thing.  I just don't like the way
it can hinder communication, especially works that end up being read by others
than the author intended.  For instance, when non-English speakers read Gazette
articles.  That's why try to keep LG as straightforward as possible.  I'd love
to clean up the spelling/grammar mistakes if I had the time, but I don't have
50 extra hours per month, so I just do the ones that seriously impede
communication.

<P> I read <EM>Trainspotting</EM> and think, the Scottish phonetic style offends my sense
of clarity, but the author's goal is to convey this style of thought/viewpoint
as much as it is to convey content, so I can accept it.  

<P> I read <EM>Star Wars</EM> and think, why does the author have to write in such a
convoluted manner?  It adds nothing to the story except to make it "hip".  

<P> I read <EM>Ratz Are Nice (PSP)</EM> and think, why does the author have to write in
such a slangy style? "They go weekend hunting looking for ruffboichail'z. They
wontz to be quickened... I Edison basically loseout 3 wayz."  Actually, I
never got past the first chapter.  I don't have time to sound out what he's
trying to say, much less guess what dialect they're speaking.  God forbid a
non-English speaker should take an interest in the book.  
I prefer a writing style readable by as wide an audience as possible.

Actually, the book switches between Scots and English pretty much at
random.  There are entire passages in English, and recent words like
"taxis" and "dealer" that have no Scots equivalent are just thrown in
unchanged, looking out of place because they're not spelled
phonetically.

<P> Of course, Scottish literature is pretty scarce and underrepresented,
and Irving Welsh is one of the few authors filling the gap.

I'm fairly close to the middle of this one, but with somewhat of a lean in
Jay's direction: there are times - especially when writing for a techie
audience - when the more spendy variety of verbal pyrotechnics (remember to
always and ever eschew needless and unnecessary word usage!) is called
for... but the reason is the one that Mike mentions: writing to a given
audience.

Believe it or not, I *am* a fan of writing differently depending on 
your audience.  I'm just pointing out that sometimes one's audience
ends up being bigger than anticipated, and the assumptions one made
about the audience no longer hold true.

<P> PS. Just in case it's unclear, I'm *not* complaining about anything
anybody's written on TAG.  This is just a problem I've seen other places.

tea much less mango lassi or jumbo smoothies.  Only coffee and soda pop.  
Oh well.

Well, *yeah*. I keep telling you to get rid of the little plastic umbrella

but would you listen?...

What flags would you use with " tcpdump " in order to
view the Ethernet source and destination addresses of
three packets with no time stamp data added ?

<P>
There's always the "--view-the-Ethernet-source-and-destination-addresses-
of-three-packets-with-no-time-stamp-data-added" switch (one of the standard
GNU long options.) Be sure to type it out every time, too; cut-and-paste
won't work, since the "cut_and_paste_detect()" function will just reject
it.

tcpdump: command line switch too long.

What do I do now, Unca Ben?

You probably mistyped it. Try it fifteen or twenty more times. If that
fails, try

tcpdump --irony

(Hint: does not mean "kinda like iron". :)
