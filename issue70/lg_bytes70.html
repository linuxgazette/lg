<FONT COLOR="green">Sklyarov, DMCA, FTAA update
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> As LG went to press, several events unfolded in the Sklyarov/DMCA case:

<UL>
<LI> A US grand jury indicted Dmitry Sklyarov for creating and selling an
"encryption circumvention" device, illegal under the Digital Millenium
Copyright Act of 1998.  Fair-use advocates were wondering whether
the Justice Department would drop the charge now that the original complaintant,
Adobe Systems, Inc, has withdrawn its complaint.  But the grand jury surprised
advocates further by expanding the charge to also indict Dmitry's employer,
Elcomsoft, with "conspiracy".  Even though Elcomsoft is located in
Russia and the product is legal there, the Justice Department claims US
jurisdiction because Elcomsoft used a US web payment organization to accept
orders.  Also the extent of the charge is surprising: Dmitry could face a
prison term of 25 years and a US$2,250,000 fine.  Elcomsoft could face a
US$2,500,000 fine.<P>

<LI> Dmitry pled not guilty to the charges.  The next step is a court trial,
which will likely take several months.  In the meantime, Dmitry is free on
US$50,000 bail but may not leave northern California. <P>

<LI> The US Copyright Office issued a report saying:
<OL>
<LI> it's too early to tell
whether the DMCA is a success 
<LI> the Office sees insufficient reeason to
amend the law at this time regarding the "first sale doctrine" (which allows
the purchaser of a book/CD/videotape to resell it, lend it or give it away as 
a used item).  Librarians want to extend this doctrine to digital media; 
publishers do not.
<LI> the Office thinks the law <EM>should</EM> be amended to allow users to
make backup copies of software and content they've purchased.
</OL>
Many fair-use advocates feel the Office failed to address significant issues
regarding free speech, and some blamed themselves for arguing their cause on
Slashdot but failing to write comments to the Copyright Office during the
public comment period, giving the Office the impression that there was little
public concern.
<BR>

<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16744-2001Aug29.html">A Washington Post article.</A> <P>

<LI> Protests continue in Moscow (Russia), London (England), Boston, San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Reno, and Black Rock City, Nevada.  In Seattle,
activists have started an education campaign at public libraries, which
consists of passing out flyers, inviting people to sign a petition, and talking
to the librarians and staff.

<P> 
The 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">
Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) is
<a href="http://www.eff.org/alerts/20010816_eff_ftaa_alert.en.html">
speaking out</a> against industry
attempts to get controversial provisions from the US Digital Millenium
Copyright Act (DMCA) put into the Free Trade of the Americas
(FTAA) agreement.  (The FTAA is a still-unfinished treaty that would
create a free-trade zone covering North and South America.) "The FTAA
organization is considering treaty language that mandates nations pass
anti-circumvention provisions similar to the DMCA, except the FTAA
treaty grants even greater control to publishers than the DMCA." If you
feel strongly about this, the EFF invites you to try to change the
situation and provides suggestions for the sort of letters you could write.

<hr width="20%" noshade>

<P> Because LG is a monthly publication, we cannot adequately address all
the developments in the DMCA controversy.  We refer you instead to the 
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/"></A>Linux
Weekly News</A> editorials, the <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/">EFF home
page</A>, and the various activist sites such as <A
HREF="http://nodmca.org/">nodmca.org</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.freesklyarov.org/">freesklyarov.org</A>.

<P> <A HREF="http://lwn.net/2001/0830/">LWN's August 30 editorial</A> raises
the irony of Dmitry possibly getting a longer prison sentance than "mere armed
robbers, rapists and child molesters".  It states, "One way or another, we are
now seeing the degree of repression that the US is willing to apply to ensure
that certain kinds of software are not written....  It takes very little
imagination to picture a future where the general-purpose computer has been
replaced by a 
<A HREF="http://www.trustedpc.org/">'trusted computing platform'</A>, and
systems which do not 'seal data within domains' are treated as 'circumvention
devices'. At what point, exactly, does Linux become an illegal device under the
DMCA?  In a world where programmers face 25-year sentences for code that was
legal where they wrote it, this vision should not be seen as overly paranoid."

<P> An <A HREF="http://lwn.net/2001/0802/">older LWN editorial</A> discusses
attempts in <STRONG>Canada</STRONG> to insert DMCA-like provisions into its
copyright law.  

<hr width="20%" noshade>

<P> Meanwhile, Slashdot reports on an 
<A HREF="http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2001/aug/010830.webcasting.html">NPR article</A>
saying that many US radio stations are pulling the plug on their webcasting
"due to concerns about advertising, royalties and the DMCA".  Slashdot then
reports on a 
<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/08/30/digital.music/index.html">CNN article</A>
about a study saying "people don't and won't purchase heavily restricted music
online at higher prices for a less useful item."  Slashdot then adds, 
"This is apparently a revelation to the music industry."

The State of Corporate IT: A case for Linux</A>.
"By many accounts, the largest cost of ownership increases that
corporations have faced have been licensing related. As NT has become a
mainstay, licensing terms have become more specific and more expensive."<BR>
This story traces a 7,000-employee company that switched from Unix/Novell
to NT for "ease of administration and a lower cost of ownership, but years
into the transition, administering and licensing costs soared....
While the previous Unix and Novell platforms had handled file, print and mail
servers on a single server, NT now needed one machine for each service plus a
dedicated backup for each.....
Red Hat brought a single Pentium class system for a site visit and thanks to
the early legwork their engineers had done, were able to integrate the box into
the network and take over all file and print server requests for one busy
segment within four hours. The system ran for the next 10 business days without
any downtime, something NT machines had not been able to do very often....
Red Hat had proven to be a helpful ally. Instead of trying to push a
whole-scale replacement of the infrastructure, they had worked to supplement
it....  Some months later, with the market still soft and the bottom line
increasingly important to shareholders, the team feels they made the right
decision."

<FONT COLOR="green">eVe Visual Search Toolkit for Linux
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> 
<a href="http://www.evisionglobal.com">
eVision</a> is excited to announce the release of version 2.1 public beta
of the eVe visual search Java-based SDK for Linux.  The  toolkit lets Linux
developers create search applications that use images and visual similarity
rather than keywords and text. 
The user selects a sample query image or partial image, then the search
engine finds and ranks other images that are visually similar with respect
to the objects in the image and attributes such as color, texture, shape
and 3D shading. This technology can be applied to image content, video
content, audio content and any other digital pattern.
You can sign up to download a  free 500 image limited version of the
SDK at
