<p>
Allmighty TAG!
</p>

<p>
first, sorry for a longish post. I'm almost at my wit's end.
</p>

<p>
I have an industrial PC, equipped with a touch screen and "VIA Nehemiah"
CPU (that behaves like i386). The PC has no fan, no keyboard, no 
harddisk, nor flash drive - only ethernet card. It boots via PXE from my 
database server. The /proc/meminfo on the PC says, that the PC has 
MemTotal: 452060 kB. I'm booting the "thinstation" 
(<a href='http://thinstation.sourceforge.net'>http://thinstation.sourceforge.net</a>) with kernel 2.6.21.1. The PC uses 
ramdisk. I boot Xorg with twm window manager. Then I start client of the 
"Opera" browser on my database server and "-display" it on the X server 
on the PC. This setup has worked flawlessly for a couple of months.
</p>

<p>
Then my end-users came with complains, that the PC doesn't boot anymore
after flipping the mains switch. For the moment, I have found following:
</p>

<p>
1. The PC sometimes doesn't boot at all. The boot process stops with
the message:
</p>

<pre>
   Uncompressing linux... OK, booting the kernel.
</pre>

<p>
...and that's all. Usually, when I switch the PC again off and on, it 
boots OK, I mean I don't change anything, just flip that big button.
</p>

<p>
2. When it really <strong>does</strong> boot all the way into X, the opera browser 
isn't able to start properly. I tried to investigate further the matter. 
I modified the setup, now I'm booting only into X+twm. This works.
</p>

<p>
Now I tried to run following test on my database server:
</p>

<pre>
    xlogo -display &lt;ip_address_of_the_pc&gt;:0
</pre>

<p>
This works, the X logo is displayed on the screen of the PC.
</p>

<p>
Now I tried this test on the database server:
</p>

<pre>
    xterm -display &lt;ip_address_of_the_pc&gt;:0
</pre>

<p>
Result is this error message on the client side (i.e. on the database 
server):
</p>

<pre>
   xterm:  fatal IO error 104 (Connection reset by peer) or KillClient 
on X server "192.168.100.171:0.0"
</pre>

<p>
...and the X server on the PC is really killed (I can't find him anymore 
in the process list on the PC).
</p>

<p>
This is, what I have found in the /var/log/boot.log on the PC:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
------------ /var/log/boot.log starts here ----------------------------
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
/etc/init.d/twm: /etc/init.d/twm: 184: xwChoice: not found
twm_startup
twm:  unable to open display ":0.0"
------------ /var/log/boot.log ends here ------------------------------
</pre>

<p>
...and this is from /var/log/messages on the PC:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>

<p>
I tried to fiddle with the BIOS parameters, i.e. reverted back to 
"factory setup" and re-entered the PXE-booting stuff. It didn't help.
</p>

<p>
I tried to limit the memory used by the ramdisk. My current parameters are:
</p>

<pre>
   append ramdisk_blocksize=1024 initrd=initrd.C0A864AB root=/dev/ram0
ramdisk_size=131072 console=ttyS3 acpi=off noapic nolapic
</pre>

<p>
...and this doesn't help, either.
</p>

<p>
Has anyone of the honorable TAG staff any clues that could help me?
Thanks in advance for any help.
</p>

<p>
Petr

Just looking at this aspect of the problem, and for the moment
disregarding the rest of the symptoms, it would appear that your problem
is hardware related.  I would suggest you start by checking the
integrity of your RAM modules, or if you have ready access to
replacement RAM, simply swap them out and see whether the problem has
gone away.
</p>

<p>
My reasoning might be flawed, but based on the fact that the machine was
working before, and the fact that you are using a RAM disk, together
with the strange behaviour on bootup, I suspect that your RAM might not
be refreshing properly.  This failure to refresh might be caused by a
faulty module, a loosely seated module (possible through vibration of
the chassis over time), or a CPU memory bus problem.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not this is the case, it is easy enough to check.
</p>

Paul

Running memtest86 for a couple of hours of even days is a good way of
finding out if the memory works or not. You can find it here:
<a href='http://www.memtest86.com/'>http://www.memtest86.com/</a>

<p>
Some live-CDs aloow booting into memtest86, too.

The last time I had flaky memory the system seized up about twice a day. 
Running memtest86 overnight didn't show any problems, but swapping in new 
memory solved the problem.

<p>
I would suggest that if memtest86 can find a problem you can rely on that, but 
a negative from memtest86 doesn't guarantee that your memory's OK.

<p>
Thank you guys,
</p>

<p>
I ran the memtest86, when it reached 5000 errors, I switched it off. 
Fortunatedly I was able to find suitable replacement for my memory. I 
swapped it, and now I'm running again without problems...

Thanks again, have a nice weekend,

<p>
Running memtest86 overnight will <em>almost</em> always pinpoint bad RAM. 
Running it for only a few hours and finding no errors doesn't mean much.
</p>

<p>
On one memorable occasion, bad RAM on my candidate replacement server
got smoked out only through resorting to iterative kernel compiles
using "make -j NN" tweaked to make sure I used <em>all</em> memory.  (After a
few tests, NN ended up being 256.)
</p>

<p>
In the referenced case, the situation really was sort of my own fault,
because, trying to save money, I'd deployed some sticks of RAM that had
a dubious history.  The entire saga of how I tracked down the bad sticks
is here, and I personally think it makes pretty good reading:

<p>
True in my experience as well. Not specifically for memtest86, but when
I was building systems, the only time I considered the memory to have
been properly "burned in" is after I ran it through "BURNIN" (this was
back in the days of DOS) for 24 hours. It was annoying, but since the
alternative was to have systems that would come back and that I'd have
to fix on my own dime - not to speak of the associated loss of
reputation for my then very-young business - it was a requirement for
any machines I sold.
 
I've also had systems with memory problems that required either a spritz
of Freon or a blast from a hair dryer set on 'high' to confess their
faults.
</p>

<p>
I'm quite happy that a) this kind of problems are quite rare anymore,
and b) that I'm doing almost nothing but software these days.

Raj: In the past, some memory chips would become thermally-sensitive as
they degraded, and could be made to fail by heating them up or (less
often) by cooling them during a memory test. You had to use this with
some discretion - obviously, you could crack the chip packages if you
flipped the temperature too rapidly - but it was a really good test that
would usually suss out otherwise difficult-to-diagnose, intermittent
memory.
</p>

<p>
Memory quality has increased greatly since those days, so I don't know
how applicable this would be today - but it was a standard part of a
techie's toolkit back then.

Just a note about temperature effects; Sometimes with failed hard 
drives, they can be put in your fridge or for a short time, in your 
freezer. Let it cool, pull it out, connect up and have your recovery 
process ready to roll NOW. You probably have only one chance to recover 
as much of your data as can be recovered. This doesn't always work of 
course, and it doesn't always let you retrieve all that you want or 
need, but hey, it's a shot when you're desperate.
