</STRONG>

<P> No other UK training site offers comparable levels of interactivity
and dynamic web services.  The secret behind the site's functionality
is it's integration of open standards, open source software, and a
smattering of in-house programming trickery. 

<P> By separating the dynamic functions from the presentational elements
of HTML, the site can constantly be adapted and improved with minimal
human intervention.  The programme code currently contains a host of
premium features which have yet to be activated. e.g. direct booking,
last-minute booking, course evaluation, trainer evaluation, freelance

<FONT COLOR="green">New IDE Backup Device (Arco)
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> HOLLYWOOD, Florida --Arco Computer Products, Inc.,
www.arcoide.com, a leading provider of low cost IDE disk
mirroring hardware, today announced the
DupliDisk RAIDcase, a real-time backup device that offers
PC users a simple and convenient way to maintain an exact,
up-to-the-minute duplicate of their IDE hard drives.

<P> <A HREF=http://www.arcoide.com/RAIDcase.htm>Photo</A>
  

<P> If a hardware failure disables one of the mirrored drives, the
other takes over automatically. External LEDs change color
to indicate a failed drive and an audible alarm alerts the user
of the drive failure but there is no interruption of service.  The
system continues to function normally until the user can find
a convenient time to power down and install a new drive.
Caddies remove easily to facilitate replacement of failed
drives. 

<P> The RAIDcase requires neither an ISA nor a PCI bus slot.  
IDE and power cables provided by Arco connect the
RAIDcase to the computer's onboard IDE controller and
power supply. Once installed, the RAIDcase operates
transparently, providing continuous automatic hard disk
backup and disk fault tolerance. All data sent from 
the PC to the primary drive is automatically duplicated 
(concurrently) to the mirroring drive but the system 
(and end user) sees only the primary drive. 

<P> The RAIDcase uses no jumper settings and requires no
driver, TSR or IRQ. Because it requires no device drivers,
the RAIDcase is essentially operating-system independent. 
It has been tested with systems running Windows 3.x, 95, 98 
and  NT, as well as OS/2, DOS, Unix, Linux, Solaris386,
BSDI and Novell NetWare.  Manufacturer's suggested retail

<FONT COLOR="green">RMS Software Legislation Initiative
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1999 04:31:52 +0000 (UTC)
<BR>From: Dwight Johnson &lt;dwj@linuxtoday.com&gt;
<BR>To: bod@li.org

<P> Richard Stallman is promoting an initiative to campaign against UCITA and
other legislation that is damaging to the free software movement.

<P> Considering the many legislative issues that affect free software, some,
like myself, believe there is a need for a Ralph Nader type of
organization to both be a watchdog and also lobby legislators to protect
the interests of free software.

<P> Richard Stallman has volunteered himself to lead off the initiative and
Below is his latest correspondence.

<P> Because the free software movement encompasses both commercial and
non-commercial interests and Linux International is an association of
commercial Linux interests, it is probably not appropriate for Linux
International to attempt to serve the watchdog and lobbying function which
is needed.

<P> There are two ways Linux International may become involved:

<P> 1) Individual companies within Linux International may wish to commit
themselves to sponsor the Richard Stallman initiative;

<P> 2) Linux International may collectively endorse and sponsor the Richard
Stallman initiative.

<P> Richard recognizes that his leadership may be controversial to some and
has told me he wants to join with 'open-source' people to support the
common cause.

<P> As Linux and free software/open-source solutions move into center stage in
the technology arena, the agendas of those who support the older model of
intellectual property to oppose the inevitability of this evolution are
becoming more sharply defined and dangerous -- they are seeking
legislative solutions.

<P> We need to pursue our own agenda and our own legislative solutions and
time is of the essence. A cursory search of the Linux Today news archives
will reveal that there are several bills on their way through the U.S.
Congress right now, in addition to UCITA, which could be disruptive to the
free software movement.

<P> I urge the Linux International Board of Directors both collectively and
individually to take action and support the Richard Stallman initiative to
defend open-source/free software against damaging legislation.

<FONT COLOR="green">News from Loki (games and video libraries)
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> TUSTIN, CA -- September 8, 1999 -- Loki Entertainment Software announces 
their third Open-Source project, the <STRONG>SDL Motion JPEG Library (SMJPEG)
</STRONG>.

<P> SMJPEG creates and displays full motion video using an open, 
non-proprietary format created by Loki. It is based on a modified version 
of the Independent JPEG Group's library for JPEG image manipulation and 
freely available source code for ADPCM audio compression. Among its many 
benefits, SMJPEG allows for arbitrary video sizes and frame-rates, 
user-tuneable compression levels, and facilities for frame-skipping and 
time synchronization.

<P> Loki developed SMJPEG in the course of porting 
Railroad Tycoon II: Gold Edition by PopTop Software and
Gathering of Developers. While Loki is contractually bound to protect the
publisher's original game code, Loki shares any improvements to the underlying
Linux software code with the Open Source community. 

<P> Loki's first Open Source project, the <STRONG>SDL MPEG Player Library 
(SMPEG)</STRONG> is 
a general purpose MPEG video/audio player for Linux, developed while 
porting their first title, Civilization: Call to Power by Activision. 
The second project is Fenris, Loki's bug system based on Bugzilla from 
the Mozilla codebase.

<P> SMJPEG, SMPEG and Fenris are freely available for download from 
<A HREF=http://www.lokigames.com>www.lokigames.com</A>, and are offered under
the GNU Library Public License (LGPL). 


<P>About Loki Entertainment Software:
Based in Orange County, CA, Loki works with leading game publishers to 
port their best-selling PC and Macintosh titles to the Linux platform. 
Loki meets a pent-up need in the Linux community by providing 
fully-supported, shrink-wrapped games for sale through traditional retail 
channels. For more information, visit www.lokigames.com.

<SPACER TYPE=vertical SIZE=20>
<P> Tustin, CA.  --  September 17, 1999 -- Loki Entertainment Software, in
cooperation with Activision, Inc. and the Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts,
announces Loki Hack 1999 to be held on October 11 through 13 at the Cobb
Galleria Centre in Atlanta in conjunction with the Atlanta Linux Showcase.

<P> Loki Entertainment Software launched the Linux version of Activision's
popular strategy game Civilization: Call to Power(TM) in May 1999 to
strong reviews. During Loki Hack, up to 30 qualified hackers will have 48
hours in a secure setting to make alterations to the Linux source code
for this game. In turn Loki will make available in binary form all
resulting work from the contest. Winners of this unique contest will be
announced during the Atlanta Linux Showcase. First prize will be a
dual-processor workstation (running Linux of course).

<P> Qualified hackers may apply to participate on the Loki web site (above).

<FONT COLOR="green">New Linux Distribution from EMJ Embedded Systems
</FONT>
</H3> 


<P> Apex, NC -- Using Linux for embedded applications on the world's 
smallest computer just got easier, thanks to the new EMJ-linux 
distribution, developed by EMJ Embedded Systems. 

<P> EMJ has compiled a small distribution that runs Linux on JUMPtec®'s 
DIMM-PC/486, saving hardware developers the hours of time required 
to modify Linux to run on the world’s smallest PC. 
The DIMM PC is a full featured 486 PC in the size of a 144-pin memory DIMM. 

<P> The DIMM-PC/486 from JUMPtec measures 40x68 mm (1.57 x 2.68 inches) 
but packs the same punch as a standard 486 PC. The DIMM-PC is perfect 
for use in high performance applications such as security apparatuses, 
medical instruments, factory automation and global positioning systems. 
It ships with 16 MB of DRAM, 16 MB of IDE compatible flash and supports 
two serial ports and a parallel port, as well as floppy and hard drive 
interfaces, a real time clock and watchdog timer, and an I2C-bus.

<P> The EMJ-linux distribution consists of a 1.4MB bootdisk. This bootdisk 
contains everything needed to do a network install of EMJ-linux. 
Currently v0.9 is a 5.7MB compressed file (9.8MB uncompressed), designed 
to download directly to DIMM-PC's 16MB Flash Drive, or to an IDE Drive. 
Once loaded, the DIMM-PC with Linux will support Ethernet, TCP/ip, 
Telnet, FTP, WWW (Apache 1.3.9), as well as two serial ports, parallel, 
floppy, IDE and VGA.

<P> EMJ-linux is based roughly on Slackware v4.0 which uses the current 
Linux kernel 2.2.x. It will be kept up to date by EMJ as Linux 
revisions occur. EMJ will also develop similar Linux solutions for other 
JUMPtec products.

<P> The EMJ-linux distribution is available on EMJ's Web site,

	[The following was written by the </EM>LG<EM> Editor, who has not used
	the software.  The web site is sparse on technical details, so the 
	comments below may not be totally correct. -Ed.]
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> <A HREF=http://www.armed.net/>Armed Linux</A> is a Linux distribution that
comes as a 192 MB zip file.  You unzip it under Windows and run a batch file
--- and it installs Linux.  <EM>Apparently</EM> (this has not been verified) it
uses the loopback device to create an entire Linux filesystem in a huge DOS
file.  An alternative to UMSDOS, for those who remember that.

<P> The current version, workstation beta 1.1, is available for free download,
or for $11.99 on CD.  It includes the Enlightenment and WindowMaker, an office
suite, Netscape, an MP3 player, and a graphics editor (GIMP?).  A server
version is planned, which will contain Apache/Samba/Sendmail etc. and an SMP
kernel.  Both versions have an automated uninstall routine, if you're 
nervous about installing an unknown program.

<FONT COLOR="green">SMART software for Linux
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> SANTA CRUZ, CA-- Free software enabling users of the Linux operating system
to monitor their hard drives and detect predictable drive failures is available
from the Concurrent Systems Laboratory at the University of California, Santa
Cruz.  Development of the software is sponsored by Quantum Corp. of Milpitas,
Calif., a leading manufacturer of hard-disk drives.

<P> The S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting
Technology) system monitors hard drives and warns of impending failures
before they happen. Originally developed by Compaq, S.M.A.R.T. technology
has become an industry standard for hard drive manufacturers.

<P> "The S.M.A.R.T. system allows the computer to talk to the hard drive and
ask how it's doing by measuring various performance parameters," said
Darrell Long, associate professor of computer science in the Jack Baskin
School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.

<P> The initial Phase I release of the S.M.A.R.T. for Linux software only
supports ATA, one of two standard interfaces for connecting hard drives to
computers. A complete software package that supports both ATA and SCSI will
be released by the end of the year, Cornwell said.

<P> The S.M.A.R.T. software for Linux is available from the
following Web site, which also has a link to a Quantum white paper on
S.M.A.R.T. technology: <A HREF=http://csl.cse.ucsc.edu/software/smart/>

<P> <A HREF=http://www.linuxone.net></A>LinuxOne</A> is offering a beta version
of its LinuxOne OS for download.  The first 100 subscribers will get it free;
afterwards, there will be a $9.95 shipping and handling charge.  (LinuxOne is
also working with MandrakeSoft to develop a Chinese-language workstation and
server distribution.)
