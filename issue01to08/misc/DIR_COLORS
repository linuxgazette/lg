# FILE:	/etc/DIR_COLORS
# 
# Configuration file for the color ls utility.
# This file goes in the /etc directory, and must be world readable.
# You can copy this file to .dir_colors in your $HOME directory to override
# the system defaults.

# COLOR needs one of these arguments:
#
#	'tty' 		color output to tty's only
#	'all' or 'yes'	color output to tty's and pipes
#	'none' or 'no'	shuts colorization off completely
#
COLOR tty

# OPTIONS allows you to specify additional commandline options for
#	the ls command.  These can be any options (check 'man ls' for details)
#
#  	-F  	show '/' for dirs, '*' for executables, etc.
#  	-T 0 	don't trust tab spacing when formatting ls output.
#
OPTIONS -F -T 0

# TERM specifies which terminal types are to be colorized.  There can
#	be multiple entries.
#
TERM linux
TERM console
TERM con132x25
TERM con132x30
TERM con132x43
TERM con132x60
TERM con80x25
TERM con80x28
TERM con80x30
TERM con80x43
TERM con80x50
TERM con80x60
TERM xterm
TERM vt100

# EIGHTBIT specifies whether to enable display of eight-bit ISO 8859
#	characters.  This is set to either:
#
#	'yes' or '1'	displays eight-bit characters
#	'no' or '0'	prevents display of eight-bit characters
#
EIGHTBIT 1

# Color init strings:
#
# These specify how various files are displayed.  A color init string
# consists of one or more of the following numeric codes:
#
# ATTRIBUTE STRINGS:
# ------------------
#
#	00 = none
#	01 = bold
#	04 = underscore
#	05 = blink
#	07 = reverse
#	08 = concealed
#
# COLOR STRINGS:
# --------------
#
# COLOR		TEXT	BACKGROUND
#
# black		30	40
# red		31	41
# green		32	42
# yellow/brown	33	43
# blue		34	44
# magenta	35	45
# cyan		36	46
# white/gray	37	47
#
# Note that the color init strings are a semi-colon delimited series of
# color codes.  For example, to specify a bright yellow text on blue
# background the string 01;33;44 would be used.
#
# The following entries define the color specifications based upon the
# file type.
#
NORMAL 00	# global default, although everything should be something.
FILE 00 	# normal file
DIR 01;34 	# directory
LINK 01;36 	# symbolic link
ORPHAN 01;05;31	# orphaned symbolic link - points to non-existent file
FIFO 40;33	# pipe
SOCK 01;35	# socket
BLK 40;33;01	# block device driver
CHR 40;33;01 	# character device driver
EXEC 01;32 	# file with executable attribute set

# These entries allow colorization based upon the file extension.  These may
# either be in the form '.ext' (such as '.gz' or '.tar') or '*ext' (such
# as '*~' used with emacs backups).  Note that using the asterisk allows you
# to specify extensions that are not necessarily preceeded by a period.
