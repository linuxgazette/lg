<h3>Not Linux</h3>

<p> There's another lengthy <a href="misc/lg_laundrette/notlinux.html">Not 
Linux</a> thread this month, courtesy of The Off-Topic Gang, which touches
on just about everything from hydrogen fuel to science centres to politics.

<p> There's also <a href="misc/lg_laundrette/python.html">The Case of the Mad
Python Programmer</a>.

<p> Here's a list of <a href="http://jill.jazzkeyboard.com/qarticles.html">funny 
Microsoft Knowledge Base articles</a>. My favourite, even if it isn't a 
<em>real</em> KB article, is: <a 
href="http://www.geocities.com/boxing4d/Q209354.htm">Q209354: HOW TO: RTFM</a>: 
"This article demonstrates how to read the f*cking manual, as popularised by 
the RTFM directive."

<p>The Register has an <a 
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/09/419_scam_anatomy/print.html">anatomy
of a 419 scam</a>, as well as a <a 
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/20/musical_preference_survey/">survey</a> 
of the musical tastes of computer professionals. 

<p> Linspire have a funny parody of The Doors' "Light My Fire". Take a look
at <a href="http://www.linspire.com/run_linspire.php">"Run Linspire"</a>, if
you have a Flash player.

<p> For those who regularly read "The Foolish Things We Do With Our Computers",
there's <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/10/11/102_ways_to_kill_your/">102
ways to kill your computer</a>, and <a href="http://rinkworks.com/stupid/">Computer

<h3>Spam Joke</h3>
<blockquote><em>

<!-- FIXME: Title & comment -->
<p>A Texan farmer goes to Australia for a vacation. There he meets an
Aussie farmer and gets talking. The Aussie shows off his big wheat
field and the Texan says, "Oh! We have wheat fields that are at least
twice as large."
</p>
<p>Then they walk around the ranch a little, and the Aussie shows off
his herd of cattle. The Texan immediately says, "We have longhorns that
are at least twice as large as your cows."
</p>
<p>The conversation has, meanwhile, almost died when the Texan sees a
herd of kangaroos hopping through the field in the distance. Amazed, he
asks, "What the hell are those?!"
</p>
<p>The Aussie replies with an incredulous look, "Don't you have any
grasshoppers in Texas?"

Well, for a small-minded person such as myself, it would be mindless
"copying", not actual understanding of a language, just as someone who
does not really understand what's going on tends to do things like use
"--force" for rpm when it "doesn't work", hoping that using it will
magically fix their problems, without ever having to understand
anything.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I've been into Roman history for the last several years, and
hanging out with a bunch of like-minded folks at novaroma.org for just
about the same length of time. 'Salve iterum, Amice' is not an unusual
greeting for me to write these days, and 'SVBEEV' (Si vales, bene est,
ego valeo) is a fairly common way to end an email when writing to other
Novaromans - although I generally prefer 'Vale' or 'Cura ut valeas'.

<p>
I don't claim that my Latin is anything but rudimentary, but salutations
aren't particularly complex. Well, actually, they are <img alt=":)" 
src="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" width="20" height="24">  - but not a
simple 'hello/goodbye" between strangers; it's when you get into
relatives and people of different status levels that it gets crazy. For
a full treatment, see Eleanor Dickey's "Latin Forms of Address"
(Oxford University Press, 2002).

I'm with Breen on this one. I love the fact that, when I find myself
floundering about while trying to spread the word about LG, Jimmy steps
up to the bat, says "that's easy", and hits a bunch of home runs in
various Linux venues. I'm just stoked when I'm stuck behind a firewall,
and Karl-Heinz comes up with some deep SSH hackery which allows me to
get and send my mail without a lot of hassle. By the same token, it
gives me pleasure when I can help the other folks here past a problem in
return.

[smile] Yeah. Libraries, I love'em. Centers of propagation of human

to my mind, and the only ray of hope for some of the folks trying to
crawl out of the muck; I damn near _lived_ in one for a few years after
coming to the States. I can't even begin to express how outraged and
scandalized I was when Baltimore - "The City That Reads", if you can
believe the incredible gall of the bastards! - decided to close a number
of their branch libraries. I - simply - have - not - the - words.

Somebody there must have experienced a fraction of a second of shame, or

they removed the magnetic stick-on signs with the above motto from the

thereafter.

<h3>Russell's Paradox</h3>

The barber who shaves everyone with a stubble except himself.

<p>

Well, when I was studying Russell's paradox, I distinctly remember my
lecturer using the anaology:

<p>
"Once there was a barber of a small village who shaved the head of every
man who did not shave their own head. Did he shave his own head?"

<p>
... and then I wished he'd never posed the question! :D

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
That's hilariously apropos. The Perl Quiz of The Week (qotw) challenge
this week is to write a basic logic parser, and Russel's Paradox has
seen a bit of discussion on that list... and I've just come back from my
massage therapist, who mentioned Russel's Paradox as something he
recently heard about in a "History of Science" course he took.

Oh, what a <b>beeeyootiful</b> perspective shift. Much better than "a white

away screaming after just a few minutes of trying to understand it

least.)

<p>
<strong>[Rick]</strong>
I think I was already laughing my ass off <em>before</em> that bit about "Since
Marby is losing his cool and beginning to turn grue" (not to mention "Do
you smell a garden path? If so, what color is it?"), but that did help
significantly.

The piece was originally published in <em>BASIS</em>, newsletter of the Bay

I'm surprised that they don't have a machinable format for
the newsletter. Great fun reading the previous issues, though.

<p>
<strong>[Rick]</strong>
I personally retyped into machine format many years' worth of prior
issues, but then later was so annoyed about the radically changed
direction of the group and its pissant new Chair (and their casual
misappropriation of my copyrighted work at his direction) that I removed
from the Net for several years all of the back issues I'd been hosting.  
Later, I put most of those back.

All of the issues <b>I</b> created (during my term as _BASIS_ editor) had

Well, the way people seems to usually "learn" Perl (i.e., by looking at

It appears that the US navy spokesman put up to answer journalists'
questions about the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is one
Lieutenant Mike Kafka.

<p>
As the article in The Register (http://www.theregister.co.uk) observes: "Yes,
you're reading that correctly. A man named Kafka has been deployed to field
questions about a prison where the criminals are only vaguely charged with
crimes, can't speak to lawyers and likely will never get out." Any
resemblance this reality bears to an actual fiction is entirely
coincidental.

A review on taint.org states:  "Silly: The Moaning Goat Meter, by
xiph.org -- a load meter written in a proper[1] programming language, and
with an inexplicably spinning fish that stares at you. 

<p>
Je suis desolé, desolé, that the Web pages for this procmeter3-like 
(but much prettier) mostly-ornamental system-monitoring widget have
disappeared.  The FAQ in particular was priceless, not to mention the
pictures with those pink flamingos in them.

Courtesy of which, I now have a complete mirror including functional
download link, at <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/mgm/">http://linuxmafia.com/mgm/</a> .  (I'll be writing to the
xiph.org people to make sure this is OK.)

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Ooops, I should have mentioned "mgm-doc" earlier.

<p>
<strong>[Rick]</strong>
Actually, this has all been quite useful.

<ol>
<li>  It's good to know that the Debian Project keeps available a
late post-1.1 CVS-checkout of the upstream xiph.org tarball
(the "mgm_1.1.cvs.20020221.orig.tar.gz" link on
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/doc/mgm-doc">http://packages.debian.org/testing/doc/mgm-doc</a> or
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/admin/mgm">http://packages.debian.org/testing/admin/mgm</a>).  That's a better
reference copy than I had previously, so I've refreshed my tarball in
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/utilities-general">http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/utilities-general</a> from it.
</li>

<li>  Looks like they've split the contents of that tarball into code 
and docs (packages mgm and mgm-doc), for Debian packaging purposes.
</li>

<li>  Also, package maintainer David Z. Maze took the trouble of tracking
down upstream mgm creator Christopher Montgomery and secured a licence
statement.  Previously, nobody at xiph.org had bothered to do this, so
technically it was proprietary software by default.  (I've retroactively
added Montgomery's licence-grant e-mail to my archived tarball.)
</li>
<p>
Anyhow, I'm <em>still</em> delighted to have resurrected the MGM Web pages for
the public's enjoyment.  Having them be fetchable in a Debian package is
nice to know about, but they really should be findable by the public on
the Web.  (Serendipitously, Montgomery's e-mail would seem to have
declared both the mgm and mgm-doc package to be "public domain", and
therefore also my Web-pages mirror, so I needn't ask permission for the
latter.)

While the version you've got via Wayback may indeed be the latest, while
the mgm pages on Xiph are gone, and all the cvs links and instructions
are borked, Moaning Goat Meter is available via Subversion from Xiph,

Well, KDM and GDM are separate entities in themselves. Being the

they also like to do thing Their Way -- to the extent that GDM actually

that's just a nightmare.

[Nod] I was conflating the three of them, but yeah - "xdm" isn't quite
as bad as the others, and GDM has not <em>actually</em> eaten any small
children while I was watching (although I've heard rumors.) KDM, now -
that thing should not be let out on the streets, or should at least be
