<!-- begin hgreeting -->
<p>
Hello everyone, and welcome once again to The Answer Gang.  As the fog starts
to lift this morning I am enjoying the fluffy greyness and savoring a good 
cup of coffee.  I leave it entirely to your imagination whether I'm talking
about the weather or my clouded thoughts.
</p><p>
We have some really juicy threads this month and I hope you like them.  I'd 
like to encourage anybody who feels like asking us questions, to consider
the following guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Please use a real subject.  We hate having to reply to "your mail" (the 
classic default coughed up by our mailers, when replying to a blank subject 
line). "Help" or "Linux trouble" is not much help to us.  I know it sounds 
strange, there's a batch of us here, but it will probably greatly increase 
your chance of being one of the lucky souls who gets a direct answer.  Try 
actually stating your linux flavor, and what kind of trouble.
Examples: "RH 7 sound config?" "SuSE NFS install" etc.

<li>
This is a <em>Linux</em> webzine - ask us questions about free software.
For those of you from AOL, if the members' help forum can't answer you,
don't expect us to be any help at all (unless it's about Linux).
Windows has its own magazines and sites, and frankly most of the Gang hasn't
used Windows except in a cross-platform context in a long time. 
<br>
That said, If you work for a Windows 'zine, you should really read one or
two of the items this issue...

<li>
Requests for anonymity are honored here.  But if you don't want us to 
publish your question and the answers, don't expect us to be interested in 
helping you much.  Several of us are consultants for a living, so unless it's 
helping a few hundred people at once, we're not inclined to do freebies.

<li>
If you're using a foreign language and can manage to use an English subject,
please give a shot at asking your question in English, too.  We're quite 
forgiving of spotty English, if we can tell what you're asking.  Otherwise 
there's a couple of months lag while we have a translator look at your stuff,
if we even have someone to translate for your language.  Babelfish is only
good for a laugh.

<li>
We reserve the right to be curmudgeonly.  So flaming us for a lack of formality
will get you laughed at.  We've also got ethics here and if you don't, you'll 
get a serious drubbing.  However, we don't bother publishing answers that don't
have some meat to them.
</ul>

<p>
Spam seems to be down this month, and I don't think we got any non-computing
questions this time around.  Must be a Christmas present 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"
                height="24" width="20" align="middle">


</p><p>
It's a new year and I look forward to some interesting New Year's resolutions.
In past years I've made selections such as 1600x1200 (the year I got the
beautiful monitor I use daily) and 600 dpi (a printer, of course)...

James I am at a loss here so I thought I would give you a try. I exited out
of a root session (not su) and I go back a couple hours later to login. I
enter my user name and lo and behold, no password prompt. So I cold boot it
(hate that) comes back up just fine, go to login ...no password prompt. Any
ideas?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

	> [Jim]
First you'll want to get to a shell prompt.  I'd treat this as
though your <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> or <TT>/bin/login</TT> files are corrupt.  So,
start Linux using the init=/bin/sh kernel parameter (passed
from the LILO: prompt --- or LOADLIN, GRUB or whatever boot
loader you're using.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If that doesn't work, get out a rescue diskette or CD.
Remember Tom's (<A HREF="http://www.toms.net/rb"
	>http://www.toms.net/rb</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once you've done that try to confirm that your <TT>/etc/passwd</TT>,
<TT>/etc/group</TT>  and various <TT>/etc/pam.d</TT> files are sane.  They
should "look right" (if you've seen copies before).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have backups of your <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> and <TT>/etc/group</TT> files,
restore them to an alternate location (<TT>/tmp</TT>) and run diff
on them.  See if the differences seem reasonable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If this is an RPM based system try the rpm <TT>-Va</TT> command
to verify the integrity of your <TT>/bin/login</TT> and other binaries.
(If you have a full tar backup of your root and <TT>/usr</TT> filesystems
you can use the 'tar df' or 'tar dzf' directives to report on
differences between your current files and those in your backup.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you're running <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> there are several ways to check the
integrity of your files; none of them is as easy to explain
and/or type as rpm <TT>-Va</TT> (that's one of the very few deficiencies
in the apt and dpkg systems).  You can run debsums or tripwire or
aide if you have any of them --- but that's probably a matter of
closing the barn door while the horses are already astray in
this case.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a possibility that your <TT>/bin/login</TT> program is corrupt
or that an attacker has compromised your system and attempted
to replace <TT>/bin/login</TT> (or some other files) with a broken
version (perhaps linked against some library you don't have
even just having the wrong permissions or something like
that).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course I'd also check the <TT>/var/log/messages</TT> and related files
to see if there are any clues in there; do a fsck on your
root filesystem, try to run <TT>/bin/login</TT> from a rescue shell
prompt, etc.  You can even temporarily replace <TT>/bin/login</TT> with a
one-line wrapper script. Rename it to login.binary or some such
an write a shell script like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>       #!/bin/sh
       exec /usr/sbin/strace -o /tmp/login.strace/$$.out /bin/login.binary
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... then try to login (rebooting as necessary, or just start
a shell on one of your virtual console with an appropriate
line in your <TT>/etc/inittab</TT> files).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's an unusual problem, but these sorts of techniques will
help you narrow down what's happening.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Obviously your kernel, your root filesystem and the init
program are working.  Your getty seems to be working
enough to display an "issue" file and accept a username.
So we've already narrowed it down to getty and login ---
either getty is failing to successfully execute the login
command, or the login command is failing to emit a password
prompt.  Since the latter is somewhat more likely we focus
on it.)

Running RH 7 - Dell Precision 420, 18GB SCSI HD @ 10K rpm, 1 CD-ROM, 1
CD-RW, 19" screen w. Diamond Fire GL1 video card and therein is the start
of my problem.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The latest version of the Diamond fire GL1 driver for linux will only
work with kernel 2.2.14. RH 7 uses 2.2.16 so I have to backtrack to an
earlier kernel in order to use Gnome &amp; <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> (I'm stuck in consoleland right
now).
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
Interesting. The first possibility that I would explore would be to search
the web (or possibly contact the author) for a patch for the Diamond video
code, rather than downgrading the kernel. Chances are relatively high that
the necessary changes would be trivial (on the other hand, it may require
a major code rewrite, but it wouldn't hurt to check.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Indeed I have installed the new (old?) kernel but on booting, only 1 scsi
host is recognized where there should be 3, there's an IDE recognition
problem, and ultimately I get the message "kernel panic: VFS: unable to
mount root fs 08:02". I have checked lilo.conf and all is well there.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
Well, the "kernel panic" message says that it's not finding a bootable
device/useable boot record on device 08:02 (if I recall correctly, that
means "device with major number 8, minor number 2", otherwise known as
"<TT>/dev/sda2</TT>", the 2nd partition of your 1st SCSI HD.) Is that what your
boot device is supposed to be? (side query: have you re-run "lilo"? It
never hurts to do so, and if you've changed <EM>anything</EM> having to do with
booting - and you have - you <EM>must</EM> do so.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

Not finding the <EM>root partition</EM> to mount.  The boot sector is a different
story, and if you made it this far, it's functioning correctly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At least your panic message has the word "root" in it.  When it happens
to me, I get a cryptic "unable to open initial VC" (=virtual console) or
something like that.  Because displaying a login: prompt requires a
virtual console, which requires a device in the <TT>/dev/</TT> directory, which
requires a root partition to be mounted.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
If you are unable to mount the root partition (you are correct in that
regard - I misspoke), I don't think that you will ever get anywhere near
the login prompt; the boot will fail at that point. It is true, though,
that a missing or damaged "<TT>/dev</TT>" directory will cause the "VC" message -
as will a "no virtual terminals" setting in the kernel configuration.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
Where did the new (old?) kernel come from? If it's a "stock" RedHat
kernel, I would be rather surprised - RH compiles theirs with every bell,
whistle, and gilliwhillikin included. I certainly haven't had any fail to
detect SCSI hosts/devices, but that may just be because I've done only a
few "RH on SCSI" installations. I certainly have not had any SCSI
detection problems with <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, even SCSI-emulation setups (that being
what I have at home.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If it's a kernel that someone else compiled, I would definitely check the
configuration... scratch that. I would not <EM>use</EM> a custom-compiled kernel
while bringing up a new system in the first place. I recommend that you
don't either.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By the way, are you certain that you should see 3 SCSI <EM>hosts</EM>, rather
than three SCSI <em>devices</em>? There is a difference, and it's an important
one. The host adapters are interfaces between the PC and the SCSI devices;
it would be exceedingly rare (if even possible) to find three of them in
one system.

You should find out which device it's complaining about.  Look in
Documentation/devices.txt in your kernel source.  Block device 8:2 is
indeed <TT>/dev/sda2.</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(You can also look in the <TT>/dev/MAKEDEV</TT> script, because this is the
script that made all those device files.  However, I find it harder to
read.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
It's even easier to look in the "<TT>/dev</TT>" directory using Midnight Commander,
and scroll down until you see a match for those numbers. Possibly simplest
of all would be
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>ls /dev|grep "8, *2 "
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Mike]
Provided the <TT>/dev</TT> directory is there and is intact.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note also that there are two types of devices, "block" and "character".
Disk drives are block devices.  The same major number may be assigned
to one block device and a different character device.

What I would like to do is take the config file from 2.2.16 and copy it
to 2.2.14. Everything but the video card works tickety boo in 2.2.16. The
problem is, where do I find the config file from 2.2.16? 2.2.14 is in
usr/src/linux of course, which was created on the install, but where does
the old .config file reside?

Is that even a good idea to solve the issue? Any and all help is mightily

I would say that this is not a good idea at all. Configurations - and
thus, config files - vary wildly between kernel versions. On the other
hand, printing out the old configuration and walking through the new one
to make sure that it's as close as possible to the original would be very
useful. On my system (I'm running Debian, but I don't think it would be
very different on others), the config file is in

This is the normal Linux convention.  Actually, you can place your build
tree anywhere, but you should make <TT>/usr/src/linux</TT> a symlink to it so
that the compiler will find the include files.  (Is this still required
now that glibc has its own kernel headers?)

Does anybody know which programs he's talking about?  Is it the standard
X screensavers (xlockmore), the xscreensaver package, or something that
comes with <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> or Gnome?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't use screensavers; I prefer to make the screen go black and switch
to power-saving mode.  If I want to watch "eye candy", I'll run an
application which does this.  Fortunately, xscreensaver screen savers can
also be run as applications in their own windows, not just as screen savers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

The radar screensaver he is talking about is one of the utilities which
can be used as an xscreensaver module, or simply run as a seperate app.
By default it just looks cute, but it has command line options to "ping"
some specified hosts your local network and thus be more realistic "sonar"
for your situation.  Several of the nicer toys like this need to be fetched
seperately from xscreensaver package itself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Gnome uses a GTK based front end to xscreensaver, which shows a number of
these sorts of descriptions, including for the extras (it mentions their
homesites, so you know where to get them from.  Maybe handy even if you
hate Gnome?)  I have to say it was useful when I was trying to decide
which modules to not bother using.  I don't really like the idea of a <EM>truly</EM>
random screen toy, as some of these artsy things are just plain ugly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't remember what K uses.  Anyways asking whether a given module is in
xscreensaver or in xlockmore is a lost cause.  The two are always in a race
and at any given time, both have lots of cool eye candy, and a lot of it is
GPL so you could port it if you felt like.  You can have both installed, but 
only run one or the other at a time.

Is there an option for specifying that I would like to be prompted for all of
the kernel options during installation, much like you get when building your
own kernel?

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

I assume that by "during installation" you mean you want to customize
the kernel options at each boot, not the first time you install Linux
using your distribution's install program.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You cannot set the compile-time options (=the "make menuconfig" options)
at boot time.  However, there are lots and lots of other kernel options
you can set from the LILO: promit or by adding an
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><code>
append="myoption1 myoption2=myvalue1,myvalue2"
</code></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
line in <TT>/etc/conf.lilo</TT> and re-running lilo.  See the Bootprompt-HOWTO
for all the options you can set.
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some other options can be set at runtime via the <TT>/proc</TT> filesystem.  For
instance,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><code>
echo 1 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</code></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
will turn on IP forwarding.  Echoing a zero will turn it off.
Documentation for these files is in the appropriate subsystems' docs and
HOWTOs.  (And actually, most are not documented very well.)

Although I have read the HOWTOs on building my own kernel, I still have not
been able to get it to work out yet.  I've had a lot of luck installing Red
Hat from the CD, but I'd like to have firewalling and IP Masq capabilities
from a "clean" installation (and remove things like PCMCIA, etc.).

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

For masquerading, you must compile the kernel with IP forwarding and IP
masquerading.  Then you need to enable it in one of your boot scripts.
For instance, my <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> <TT>/etc/init.d/rc.firewall</TT> contains:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp # Only neded if masquerading non-passive FTP.
<BR>echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward # Turn on IP forwarding.
<BR>/sbin/ipchains -M -S 7200 10 160 # Debian default timeouts.
<BR>/sbin/ipchains -P forward DENY # Deny any other kinds of forwarding.
<BR>/sbin/ipchains -A forward -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j MASQ
<BR># Masquerade from the 10.0.0.0 network to the outside world.
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Try running these commands manually and see if you can get masquerading
working with your current kernel.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For more security, you can build a more elaborate set of ipchains rules.
(Note: ipchains requires a 2.2.x kernel, which I assume is what you
have.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

The Debian installer does ask about these things, but just to prepare
the modules listing, not to prepare a whole kernel.  And its prompts are
rather wimpy - you really have best luck if you already know what you are
looking for.

kpackage is allegedly able to deal with both .deb and .rpm package types.
I assume that you still need the underlying libraries, so it knows what to
call.  It may also be strongly dependent on alien, a script which eases the
conversion between package types.

This is more a matter of the library dependencies than the limits of
any one distro.  ldd &lt;binaryname&gt; would tell you which libraries it
expects, and if those are really already present, you can force it to
install, over its packagemaneger's objection, and it will work.

Sort of contrary to this, people call "Bastille Linux" a distro even
though it's strictly symbiotic to RedHat.  You might look at Rock Linux
(designed to put the whole thing together from sources) or piggyback on
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> (which was an early distro, and is pretty strong in the compiler
department) or on debian (if it's got the packages you want already, since
it has so many).

<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

Therefore plan <TT>-&gt;</TT> Have the sources, binaries (*.rpm, slackware *.tgz,
*.deb, etc..) on a CDROM and have a Tcl/Tk script to install your
choice. The script would try to compile the sources for your Linux
distro if none of the binaries packed with the CDROM works for you.
I realise that a script that compiles from source for your distro of
linux will take a loooooot of time, and it is close to impossible
to make it work for all distros .. SO ANY IDEAS??

If you also provide the basic libraries that your packages expect, and you
are <EM>really</EM> careful about adding them, you could do okay.  The tricky part
is things like libjpeg6a versus libjpeg6b (for example).  If you get some
app that really only wants a specific libary and nothing else will do, you'll

The point of using LD_PRELOAD would be if using this with an unknown locally

Yes.  I've heard that the Netgear NAS (network attached storage)
products use an embedded Linux system).  However I don't know
any details about their configuration.

I have a bit of sympathy in my heart for data recovery companies,
because we had to use one at the hospital I worked at in 1994.  I was
doing data entry into a FoxPro database and the Novell server crashed.
To top it off, this was 3pm on Christmas Eve and most people were gone.
Troubleshooting proved that the server would reliably crash when
accessing the middle of certain files in the NetWare filesystem--and
these were the database data files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It took a week to recover.  We were between sysadmins and didn't have a
backup, because our disk capacity was 2 GB but our tape drive had not
kept pace -- it was still a measly 250 MB model.  A guest sysadmin from
the hospital-wide pool came, did the standard bindery tests (akin to
fsck), called a couple consultants who didn't help, called a CNE but
didn't engage him since he wouldn't have done more than we'd already
done--but would have charged $50 anyway!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We discovered that disk mirroring is not always a good thing.  The
mirror drive was supposed to be our backup.  And it did backup well:
it backed up the corrupted data!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The sysadmin noted my comments about the hard drive making noises, and
wrote in a report, "It done sound like a car need bearings."  We sent
the drive to OnTrack; they took it apart, charged $2000, and sent back a
tape containing all the files they could recover.  Out of all the
consultants and CNEs we called, they were the only competent ones in
this whole process.  They also sent back an amusing analysis report:
"Severe hard drive damage.  Drive should be replaced."  Duh!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We replaced both drives, because the other one was acting up too.  Both
were part of a bad Maxtor batch that were causing problems in other
parts of the hospital as well.  They had 12-month warranties, and the
drives were failing in the 11th or 13th months.

You don't mention <EM>which</EM> ISO images you're downloading.  It's
probably excessive in any event.  Generally you can install a
fairly full Linux distribution from one CD (the second CD on many
distributions contains source code and/or extra software, sometimes

This is a very difficult question to answer given that you haven't

If you want just a minimal Linux installation to just copy data off a
Linux partition, consider Tom's Root Boot.  It's a minimal Linux system
on a bootable floppy, with the utilities needed in a typical rescue

This part would be quite easy once you have Linux installed.
Linux support FAT32 and MS-DOS filesystems (including the VFAT
long filename support).  So you'd use a command sequence
something like this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>  mkdir /mnt/netgear
  mkdir /mnt/windows
  mount -t ext2 /dev/hdb1 /mnt/netgear
  mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows
  cd /mnt/netgear &amp;&amp; cp -ax . /mnt/windows
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... this assumes that you have installed Linux unto your first
IDE drive (the master on the primary controller) which is called
<TT>/dev/hda</TT> under Linux.  It therefore assumes that the hard drive
which you've extracted from the Netgear NAS unit is the second
IDE drive (slave on the primary IDE controller) which is called
<TT>/dev/hdb</TT> under Linux.  This all presumes that you made the necessary
changes to the pin settings on your hard drives to get the hardware
working.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I also assume that you're using a SCSI disk (though you could use
a third or fourth IDE drive --- or even a fifth, sixth, etc).
<TT>/dev/sda</TT> is the first SCSI hard drive on any normal Linux system
(though this may change in the future, with devfs).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, this example makes many assumptions about how you've
installed Linux and what hardware you have available.  There are
<EM>MANY</EM> other ways to do this.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Other than that the example basically makes a pair of mountpoints
(places at which filesystem can be connected), mounts the
Netgear drive to one and the Win '9x drive/filesystem to another
changes to the top of the netgear directory tree and copies
everything on that filesystem (recursively) unto the VFAT partition.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: I'm also assuming that the Netgear is not functioning as a
NAS and that you're removing the hard disk from it and connnecting
it to one of your lab machines.  That seems pretty obvious to me,
since you'd just attach to it via the network directly from a
Win '9x/NT box if the NAS services were working; right?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm also assuming that Netgear is using ext2 (the dominant Linux
native filesystem).  If they're using Reiserfs or some other
filesystem --- then you'd have to do things a bit differently.
If that is the case; you'd be best advised to use the <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>
distribution which already includes support for Reiserfs ---
otherwise you'd have to patch and build your own custom kernels;
which is not a task to be undertaken by novices.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(S.u.S.E. is the only major distribution that already supports
Reiserfs.  Netgear <EM>might</EM> have patched their system to support
it given that Reiserfs' "journaling" features would be <EM>very</EM>
desirable on any Linux-based headless NAS device!)

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Jim]
There used to be a set of ext2 (Linux extended filesystem version
2) utilities for OS/2 and Win32 (NT and '9x).  However I'm not
sure that they are the best for your purposes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It would probably be best to buy a nice large hard drive
(6Gb or better), put it in one of your lab workstations,
install Linux from CD (I prefer <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>; but S.u.S.E. might
be more to your liking --- S.u.S.E. is the most popular
distribution in Europe and has very good support for various
continental languages).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once you have Linux installed and the Netgear drive attached
you can "dump" a raw (bitwise) image of the entire drive into
a single Linux file using a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>   dd if=/dev/hdb of=/some/path/with/lots/of/free/space bs=1024k
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... or you could dump each filesystem/partition by using
the commands:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>   fdisk -l /dev/hdb
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... and then (for each of the partitions listed there:
let's say it's 1, 2, 3, <EM>5</EM> and 6; skipping 4 since it might/would
be the extended partiton container:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>   for i in 1 2 3 5 6; do
      dd if=/dev/hdb$i of=/lots-of-space/netgear-image.hdb$i.bin
      done
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(This last is a bit fancy for a novice.  However, you can just
type the commands one at a time until that little snippet of
shell code makes sense).  (Obviously you'll need to put in
your own names in place of the of= paths that I've listed here).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
NOTE:  if the netgear filesystems are larger than 2Gb then
you might need a very new kernel with LFS (large filesystem support)
or you could use "raw" partitions (unallocated space) on your
new large Linux disk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This "dd" approach is handy if you want to preserve a full
snapshot of the filesystem (in it's damaged state) before attempting
data recovery.  That way, if your filesystem check and repair
efforts cause <EM>more</EM> damage you can always start from scratch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In general I'd say that there is <EM>way</EM> too much about Linux to
learn before you'd understand how to do filesystem or data recovery.
As I'm sure you know from your experience with FAT/VFAT/FAT32 based
filesystems, one must generally be expert in an OS prior to being
competant at data recovery under it.

You could look for a good Linux training consultant to come
in and give you're team a crash course.  You'll find that Linux
really is a data recovery person's dream tool suite.  Although it's
not "easy to use" it does offer <EM>full</EM> access to the system
hardware and has very good support for the filesystems of various
operating systems.

Linux began life as a kernel that would act like Minix but run on Linus'
80386 and mount up his minix filesystems.  He shared it and was encouraged
by folks submitting their own patches.  People just can't make their mouth
say "Linus' Minix" for very long, but I can't pinpoint when it got compressed
to Linux.  Maybe one of our readers could

Vaguely I recall Lars Wirzenius mentioning the origin of the
name Linux in a talk at Linux Expo 1998.  I think he said something
like it wasn't Linus who came up with the name.  He just uploaded it
to the FTP site and the FTP admin had to come up with a label for it,
so he called it Linux.  But I may be remembering wrong.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Where's that message where Linus recounts how his first success in
building Linux was to develop a multitasker that allowed one process
to write "a" repeatedly to the screen while another process wrote "b"?
I think in there it mentions that one of his early names for the
system, when he was in an extremely frustrated mood, was Buggix.

There is someone who presently administers the trademark work UNIX and they
don't feel like branding Linux with it for free.  <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> has the same
"problem" - both are at this point well established systems that people
already experienced in UNIX will find comfortable features in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The trademark began life as AT&amp;T Bell Labs UNIX, and has been traded and
sold a number of times since.  For a while Novell owned it ... in fact,
for a brief time it looked like Novell could become the source of a new,
completely non Microsoft based system, because they had Netware, they
had DR DOS, they had WordPerfect and its family of apps... but they either
didn't see it or had so many internal politics they couldn't do it.

The current trademark holders are the Open Group.   Their babble about

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyways, UNIX shouldn't be used as a generic term, because that's against
the principles of trademark.  Let me illustrate with an example that a few
more people will understand.  You can't call something Coca-Cola
(<A HREF="http://www.coca-cola.com"
	>http://www.coca-cola.com</A>) that's not.  You're not supposed to call it Pepsi
either (<A HREF="http://www.pepsi.com"
	>http://www.pepsi.com</A>, but you can't use the site at all from lynx;
try their investor relations site, <A HREF="http://www.pepsico.com"
	>http://www.pepsico.com</A> instead) unless it's
really Pepsi.  But you can call it a "Coca-Cola like soda" or say something
"tastes kinda like Pepsi" and you're safest with "a cola" or "a soda pop".
For the curious out there, I drink either, but prefer RC
(<A HREF="http://www.rccola.com"
	>http://www.rccola.com</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So Linux is "an operating system" which only "tastes like MS Windows" if you
select a window manager with a theme that tries really hard to do that,
but tends to "taste like UNIX".  Admittedly it tastes a bit more like these
if you go the extra mile and run <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A> or have the iBCS compatability module
around so you could try to run the respective binaries.

Solaris is a version of Linux because it can run programs compiled for

Unfortunately, once a system is compromised, you can't trust
the pieces.  The skilful cracker, or even the less skilled
in this day of script kiddees, will have replaced system binaries
such as <TT>/bin/login</TT>, <TT>/bin/ls</TT>, <TT>/bin/ps</TT>, and on and on.  This places
you in a shifting hall of mirrors when you attempt repair on a
running system.  Especially if you attempt this repair while the
system is connected to the network.  I know very few sysadmins
who would be up to this challenge, fewer still who would be
assured of success, and almost none who would attempt it except
on a wager or as a sport.  I would be the last to suggest
you attempt this based on a few pointers.

'<a href="../issue52/okopnik.html"><em>"Cannot execute <TT>/bin/bash:</TT> Permission denied" - solved!</em></a>' article in Issue #52 of the Linux Gazette.
It may contain an answer to your question. Note also that people <EM>are</EM>
able to log in if your ftp, etc. services are usable - they are logging in
as a very low-privilege user ("nobody", or "ftp"), but they <EM>are</EM> logging
in.

Here's an even faster possibility (maybe even the same) - did you upgrade
PAM recently by any chance?  The default files from a PAM upgrade usually
are not the same as your normal policy.  One time I ended up only being
able to get in via ssh ... and that, only because my key was already in
place, so it wasn't dropping down to standard authentication.

	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
Second - when you do log in via 'single', what does the system look like?
Has the password file changed? (Hint: it is a Good Idea to have dated
snapshots of "<TT>/etc</TT>" along with your regular backups; a tarred/gzipped
archive should easily fit on a floppy.) Try making a copy of "<TT>/etc/passwd</TT>"
(or "<TT>/etc/shadow</TT>" if you use shadow passwords), then edit it to remove the
password hash for root -
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>root:1XaFDYn7EapuP:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Chop out the second field:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you next log in as "root", you won't need a password - just make sure
to create one immediately. If you <EM>still</EM> cannot log in, then something in
the system itself is giving you problems; once again, refer to the above
article.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As to reasons <EM>why</EM> this happened in the first place: well, the scary-but-
obvious reason could be that some "script-kiddie" got into your system and
did a dance on it. Not to panic; as long as you've got good backups, the
damage can be undone (and if you're running a publicly accessible server
and _don't_ have backups, I'm afraid you've gone beyond any help I can
give.) It could also be that some program you've installed - and I haven't
heard of anything like this with progs from established distributions,
whereas just slapping in a random tarball could do this - has messed up
your libraries or other vital files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In my experience with Linux, I've come to an expectation that I did not
have with MS Windows or OS/2 - "stuff" doesn't just happen. There <EM>is</EM> a
reason for this; whether a security problem caused by random services
enabled in "<TT>/etc/inetd.conf</TT>" (I strongly suggest reading the Security-HOWTO
if you have not done so previously) or a problematic program installation,
you need to track it down and resolve it. Particularly in the case of a
break-in, it is not something you want to happen again.

Thanks so much for the speedy reply.  I'm going to read through your e-mail
very carefully.  I can tell you that I've done nothing to the server for
months accept FTP files to it, Telnet to it, add a couple of users etc.
It's been running perfectly since August of this year, and so I "think" I
can rule out my actions as the cause.  I haven't installed any additional
programs.  As for the security issue, this was and still is my immediate
concern.  I wonder if someone has got in and done "something".  I did see a
couple of bad login attempts using lastb.  I do have copies of ALL important
files, and so could simply reinstall the OS, but then I'd be no better
off...just waiting for it to happen again.
Thanks once again for your help.  I'll let you know if I find the cause.

Just to hazard a guess - since I don't know the layout of your system or
anything else about it - an attacker may indeed have come in via your
remote print system; there are exploits (if I remember correctly) that use
it, since it requires a high level of privilege to access the hardware
ports. I would at least check into security measures involving the print
system - the first of which would be to make sure that I'm running "rlpr"
or "lprng" for my remote services. The second would most likely be a
search of COTSE &lt;<A HREF="http://www.cotse.com/unix.htm&gt"

I booted up another pc with RH 7.0 and
noticed that its <TT>/bin/login</TT> ownership is root and root.  I tried chown
root.root login, but get the 'permission denied response'.  I also edited
<TT>/etc/shadow</TT> with no luck.  I agree with your theory that reinstalling
teaches you nothing.  My master plan was to FTP the login "program" from a
working pc to the server in the hope that login is somehow corrupted on the

"<TT>/bin/login</TT>" and "<TT>/bin/bash</TT>" are typically good things to check when
looking for intrusion "footprints", especially a "<TT>/bin/bash</TT>" that's been
set SUID (this means that anyone running that shell has full root
privileges!) The fact that you're unable to chown "login" means that
FTPing a good "login" binary will not help - you probably won't be able to
delete the old one. In fact, it's a pretty strong indicator that...

I rebooted the server using the linux single command, and then SU to login

...somebody got in. I assume I don't need to mention that you need to
immediately take your system off the network - given that he has root
access, your attacker could easily wipe out your entire system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I would guess, even though you haven't mentioned this, that they ran a
"chattr +i" on the "<TT>/bin/login</TT>" that they had installed - this would be the
reason that you can't delete "<TT>/bin/login</TT>". You can remove the "immutable"
flag set by "chattr" by running "chattr <TT>-i</TT> <TT>/bin/login</TT>"; this should allow
you to delete/replace it with a non-'rootkit' "login".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By the way - one of the ways you can usually tell the replacements is by
looking at the size of the executable. The 'rootkit' types, due to the
fact that they can't be dynamically linked (they have to be able to work on
a system whether it has their required libraries or not), are normally much
larger.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a way, you should consider yourself lucky - a really knowledgeable
cracker would have replaced your "<TT>/sbin/syslogd</TT>" and cleaned up your
logfiles. You would never have known that anyone had been in there. Also,
the very fact that he screwed up "login" to that degree shows him to be an
amateur - a successful system crack is nowhere nearly that obvious or
crude.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once again, I strongly recommend reading the Security-HOWTO and doing some
research. Leave your system off-line until you're satisfied 1) that you
understand how the attacker got in, 2) have securely patched that hole,
and 3) have done a general security survey of your system and are
reasonably satisfied with its state. If you're setting up a publicly-
accessible server and have not studied the security aspect, you're letting
yourself in for a large heap of trouble - as you have found out.

This is Linux Gazette, not Windows Gazette.  You'd get a better
answer by asking a Windows group.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
.max is not a normal image extension like .jpg, .gif, .png.  It
is very likely the recipient does not have a .max reader installed.
Nowadays they probably DO have a .jpg viewer of some sort
already installed.  How to view the image depends totally on the
recipient's mail program and other software.  At worst, they can save
the .jpg's as files and view them in Netscape or Internet Explorer using
a URL like file:/directory/filename.jpg .  (May need "\" or "\\"
and a "c:" prefix under Windows?)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
IF they are running Windows, it's possible something called "File
Associations" has a bad configuration.  This is a table that tells
Windows which program to use to open a .jpg or .jpeg file when you
double-click it.  In Win95, it was a setting in Windows Explorer off one
of the menus somewhere.  In Win98/2000, I have no idea where it is.

Is Linux on your primary drive or second drive?  If it's on your second
drive, use Windows fdisk program to delete the Linux partitions and
create DOS partition(s).  If you can't find a graphical fdisk program
under the start menu, open a DOS box and type "fdisk".  Choose the
option to switch drives if necessary), then the option to print
partition information.  Verify which are the Linux partition(s) and
delete them.  Then either make one big DOS partition or several small
ones.  Close and reboot, open My Computer, right-click on each new
partition and choose "Format" from the menu.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If Linux is on your primary drive, can you switch the drive cables
and/or jumpers to make Windows the primary drive?  Be warned that
Windows programs tend to go into convulsions if you change drive letters on
them.  Windows assigns drive letters according to which partitions it
finds first, so moving drives around or changing DOS partitions changes
the drive letters.  Use the Windows utility to make a rescue floppy
first.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you're using LILO to boot, you can eliminate it by using
"<TT>fdisk /mbr</TT>", an undocumented option to Windows' fdisk program.  This
replaces the master boot record on the disk with Windows' default
version.  Note that Windows' boot loader is primitive: it won't
give you a menu, it'll just boot whichever primary partition is active
(on the first disk only).  You must first make that partition active
(=bootable) using fdisk, and ensure ONLY ONE partition is active.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

Note that most versions of MS FDISK will refuse to remove
non-MS-DOS partitions.  You can use Linux fdisk to remove partitions
or you can use dd to complete wipe out all data on the Linux
disk which will make it look like it's fresh from the factory
so far as MS is concerned.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Also note that swapping drive letters out from under a MS OS
installation is basically guaranteed to hurt worse than backing
up your data to floppies, re-installing the OS from scratch,
re-installing all applications and restore copies of your data
into place.  (This re-installation process has the added benefit
of ensure that you have backups and of cleaning out all of the
cruft that tends to accumulate in Microsoft based operating
systems over time).

When I use it, it just asks, "Delete non-DOS partition?" and does
it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can use Linux fdisk to delete the partition, but be careful,
because then Linux won't exist but will still be running.  Do it
in single-user mode (type "linux single" at the LILO prompt),
then reboot immediately after exiting the program.  Even better
would be to boot from a Linux rescue floppy (which probably came
with your distribution) so that you're not deleting the
currently-running system.

Let's assume that you have two IDE drives and that you have
Linux installed on what MS-DOS/MS Windows would call your "D:"
drive (<TT>/dev/hdb</TT> or <TT>/dev/hdc</TT> or even possibly <TT>/dev/hdd</TT> under Linux).
Obviously that could be <TT>/dev/sda</TT> if you're using a combination of IDE
and SCSI or <TT>/dev/sdb</TT> if you have two SCSI drives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, let's assume that MS Windows is installed on <TT>/dev/hda</TT> and
that Linux is on <TT>/dev/hdc</TT> (perhaps your CD-ROM drive is <TT>/dev/hdb</TT>
<TT>/dev/hdd</TT>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To remove Linux as though it had NEVER been there you can follow
these steps:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>      lilo -u /dev/hda

<BLOCKQUOTE>
... should attempt to copy <TT>/boot/boot.0300</TT> back into <TT>/dev/hda</TT>
(that should have been the backup copy of your original master
boot record --- MBR).  If that does work then prepare an MS-DOS
boot floppy (ask Microsoft how to do that with newer versions
of Win'9x; they'll swear that Win'9x isn't really DOS anymore,
but they're lying, of course).

I'm going to guess that you're logging through some graphical
service (xdm, kdm, gdm, etc).  That would be the most common case
where you could log in as root and not see a text console and a
shell prompt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, assuming that this is the case the question becomes:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
How do I get to a root shell prompt?
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are many possibilities.  X can be configured to run any
of a number of GUIs (graphical user interfaces) such as <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A>, twm, fvwm, etc.  Any of those can be configured to offer
a very limited number of menus (possibly no menus at all).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Typically you access your GUI's menus under X by clicking on the
"wall paper" (or screen "background" which is technically called the
"root window" in X parlance).  That will bring up the "root menu."
(The windows and menus in X are thought of as a tree, just as your
filesystems are trees of directories, and subdirectories (branches)
and files (leaves).  You might have to click with your right or
middle mouse buttons. That is configurable in most X window managers.
There might even be different menus that come up for each mouse
button.  Typically one set of them would be the main set of menu
options and the other(s) would contain some special window manager
features to resize, raise, lower, move and destroy windows, select
"minimized" or "hidden" applications etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you find the main menu tree you can search it for some entry
such as "xterm" or "rxvt" or "eterm" or "kterm" or for entries
that are referred to as "shells."  Since X is completely configurable
the labels on the menus can be <EM>anything</EM>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of that aside it's probably easiest to skip all of this GUI
rigamarole. There are a couple of ways to do this.  On most
systems you could switch away from X (and/or any of the display
managers -- the various graphical login tools) using the following
keystrokes:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
[Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F1]
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(That's holding down the "control" and the "alt" keys and typing
in the first function key).  That should bring you to a text mode
login console (which is a virtual terminal/console running any of
the "getty" programs, usually mingetty under Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From there you can log in as root and you should be presented with
a shell prompt (usually ending in a "#" hash/pound sign which
conventionally indicates a root prompt).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If that fails then you'll probably want to "break in" by rebooting.
It's possible for someone to configure a Linux box such that
there are no getty's running on any virtual consoles.  It's even
possible to configure one to run multiple different X sessions
concurrently.  I have a workstation at my new office which is
running four different xdm sessions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, if you system has been configured to remove the text
virtual consoles, or if you're running a distribution that only
makes a GUI available by default, then you'll want to reboot.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The easiest way to reboot from a graphical session under Linux
is to type:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
[Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Backspace], [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Del]
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...in rapid succession.  The first keystroke combination will
kill the X server, the other one will signal init (the process
manager under Linux) to perform a reboot.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course either of these features <EM>might</EM> also be disabled!
If that's the case then just hit the reset button on your
system, or flip the power switch (wait about 30 seconds and
turn it back on) or pull the power plug.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
While it's booting wait for the keyboard lights to flash a
couple of times (while the system counts its memory, checks
it's floppies, etc).  There will <EM>probably</EM> be a LILO prompt
(possibly this will be quite brief.  So, as soon as you see
the keyboard caps lock, scroll lock, and num lock lights
flicker, turn on the caps and/or scroll lock.  If they flick
back off in a second, turn them back on and hold down any
shift or control key.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of these shenanigans are intended to interrupt LILO
(the most popular Linux loader) and convince it to give you
a prompt.  At that prompt type:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>	    linux init=/bin/sh rw
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Actually you might have to replace the first word in that
line with something else.  What else?  That depends.  LILO
can be configured to call the Linux installations or "stanzas"
by any name you'd like.  Also LILO can be configured not
to allow any interruption or it can be configured to require a
password to boot or to bypass the normal boot procedure.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, more than 99% of all the Linux boxes in the world
today will give you a root prompt if you follow this last
procedure.  There are only a few freaks like me that know enough
about Linux to configure LILO with passwords and/or to ignore
all attempts to get at a LILO prompt.  (Of course there are
other boot managers for Linux.  In particular newer versions
of Mandrake might use GRUB --- the grand unified bootloader;
and I haven't studied that one at all.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the <EM>highly</EM> unlikely event that you <EM>still</EM> can't get at
a root prompt then you'll want to boot from a floppy or a
CD (such as the <A HREF="http://www.linuxcare.com/">Linuxcare</A> bootable business card or one of
its clones).  I'm not going to go into the details on that
for right now.  If you need to know how to do that just
search Google! (<A HREF="http://www.google.com/linux"
	>http://www.google.com/linux</A>) for "recovery
disk" or go to Tom Oehser's site and read about Tom's
"root/boot" disk images (<A HREF="http://www.toms.net/rb"
	>http://www.toms.net/rb</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Notice that most of the difficulty here is that I have
no idea how your Linux system is configured, nor do I have
any idea what distribution you're running.  As you might have
guessed from this long set of directions Linux is a bit
configurable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously once you get to a root prompt you can just
use the command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>        fdisk /dev/hda
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to work on the partitions on your primary IDE drive.
(You can use <TT>/dev/hdb</TT> for the secondardy IDE on the first
controller, <TT>/dev/hdc</TT> for the primary drive on the secondary
controller, etc; and you can use <TT>/dev/sda</TT>, <TT>/dev/sdb</TT>, etc
if you're using SCSI drives).

I've managed to work myself into quite the dilemma. Somehow my root
password has been deleted, so I can no longer enter my system except by
a second login, which does not have write permissions on anything or the
ability to acces linuxconf or userconf. I'm using RedHat Linux on a
dual-pentium box. However, I've found that the RedHat cd is far from
adequate for rescue purposes, so I created a mandrake cd, and can use it
to edit files. What do you suggest I do? Thanks in advance for your time
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
I've found that the RedHat CD (or boot floppy) actually works reasonably
well as a rescue disk - flipping to the 2nd console via "Alt-F2" and
mounting the existing hard drive is the answer (RedHat tech support told me
it couldn't be done and I should reinstall. &lt;sigh&gt
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> Whichever you choose,
fixing the root password problem is pretty easy - and before anybody starts
storming about it being a HUGE security hole, remember that "physical
access=root access". Period. It's the reason that locked server closets and
machine rooms exist. If you want just that tiny bit of extra security (your
eight-year-old computer genius has been trying random passwords against
"root" or some such), disable the floppy/CD boot and password the BIOS
(write your hard drive's cylinder/head/sector info on the side of the PC
case and *don't* lose <EM>that</EM> password; resetting the BIOS can be a touchy
business.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So - boot your machine via a boot disk or CD. Mount the offending drive -
for this example, we'll say you have it under "<TT>/mnt</TT>". Edit
"<TT>/mnt/etc/passwd</TT>" (or "<TT>/mnt/etc/shadow</TT>" if you use shadow passwords) and
clear out the second field in the "root" entry (fields are separated by
colons) - that's the encrypted password. In other words, given an entry
that looks like this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>root:2St5fADe4oOcSE:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
you should end up with this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Save the file and reboot, this time without the boot disk. Log in as root (no
password necessary) and immediately assign one using the "passwd" utility.
No muss, no fuss, no greasy aftertaste. And, umm, keep a close watch on

Yep; I remember cursing and scratching my head over this one quite a while
ago. You've got the right idea in looking at the permissions/ownership of
the mount point - but as you've found out, you can't just change them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's the solution that I've used. I like this one, since it would work
well on a multiuser system as well as a regular home system. First, create
a group called "msdos". Note its GID (the number associated with that
group; take a look with 'vigr'.) Add yourself to that group -
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>adduser jfox msdos
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(assuming your username is 'jfox'.) Now, in your '<TT>/etc/fstab</TT>', add the
"noexec", "umask" and "gid" parameters to the appropriate partition:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>/dev/hda3  /mnt/msdos  vfat  noexec,umask=003,gid=1001  0 0
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously, the GID would be that of the "msdos" group.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What we're doing here is mounting that partition with the appropriate group
ID and setting the umask - this masks <EM>out</EM> the permissions that the
mounted partition will have. The "noexec" parameter works with in concert
with the other two to produce the following conditions:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
Directory access under the mountpoint is allowed to members of GID 1001
All files under the mountpoint are readable <EM>and</EM> writable by GID 1001
The files are "read-only" to the other users
None of the files are executable (does not apply to DOS emulation)
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It takes a bit to get used to this three-parameter control system, but
it is actually very flexible and can be used to set up just about any
combination of permissions and directory accessibility you could want.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From this point on, if you want to give a user on your system read/write
access to the files on that partition, simply add them to the "msdos"
group.

You're welcome - glad I could help! Just as an idea, if you perceive this
as a topic that lacks coverage in the Linux community, consider writing a
HOWTO - the Linux Documentation Project, under whose auspices the LG

It's yet another way to put something back in as a return for the effort
that other Linux folks have put out - and this kind of feedback is
precisely what allows a community to grow.

That's cool that

with the two New Riders' books on Python and PHP, so I'll have to take a look

more so than books three times their size.

I spend about 99.8% of my time in Windoze.......(snore.....) so please
forgive some rather newbie questions, but I have an idea that incorporates
Linux in a big way.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Let me give you a short Linux bio...
I was first exposed to Linux back in 1997 when someone at my ISP mentioned
using it for an internal mail server.  I figured "...how hard can it be..".
I went and bought a book which included 3 distros.  I ended up using <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>
Openlinux Lite 1.0.  (because it was the only one that would install)  In
about a week I got Sendmail to work with the ISP through a dial-up SLIP/PPP
connection.  At that time we only had a single company dial-up account so I
had the machine using a crontab to dial-up and kick the SMTP server every 3
hours or so.  The "kicking" part was something I found to make SMTP work
through a dynamic dial-up account.  Later I installed ISDN and a router and
got a static IP so we were live and just had to turn off the crontab.  I got
burned on "relaying" with that server and didn't know how to turn it off so
I installed Caldera OpenLinux 2.3 because it contained the new distribution
of Sendmail with relaying blocked out-of-the-box.

Yes.  Sendmail has a near vertical learning curve (and qmail is even
more confusing for me).  I actually like Postfix (now that I've tried it)
but I'm NOT recommending that you switch to a new MTA (mail transport
agent).  You got something that works well enough.  You've learned enough
to get by; and if you need to hire a consultant than there are LOTS of
them that know sendmail and very few who understand the corresponding
intricacies of qmail, Postfix, exim or any other MTA.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a really cool option to consider.  You could buy the commercial
sendmail package and use it's little configuration system.  You'd still
be running the same sendmail that you are now; but you'd have a somewhat
less gruesome interface for doing the basic configuration.  (If you later
had really special needs you could have someone start with those basic
configuration files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Look at <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.com"
	>http://www.sendmail.com</A> for information on pricing and all of
that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for setting the "maximum message size" limit: you should be able
to edit your <TT>.../sendmail.cf</TT> file (either in <TT>/etc/</TT> or in <TT>/etc/mail/</TT>
depending on your distribution) and find a line that looks something
like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>#O MaxMessageSize=1000000
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to make that work just remove that first character (the '#' or
hash sign) which "uncomments" that line.  The value is in characters
or octets (I'm not really sure which --- but they are the same for
ASCII and I doubt that you're getting alot of Unicode or UTF8 traffic
yet).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you don't find this line then insert it somewhere in the
first section of the .cf file.  That means to put it before the
first line that starts with a P (which looks like the following
line in one of my sendmail.cf files):
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>Pfirst-class=0
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sendmail isn't terribly picky about what order the options
appear in, but it can be picky about which "section" they're
in.  (In other words the options should all be grouped together
near the top of the cf file, the re-writing rules should all
be grouped together near the end of the file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note:  It's better if you're using a macro config file (usually
named &lt;something&gt;.mc).  So, here's a simple sample .mc file
showing a valid confMAX_MESSAGE_SIZE definition:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>divert(-1)

Most of represents a typical sendmail .mc file.  In order to
use this to generate a .cf file (which is what sendmail uses)
we issue a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>	m4 &lt; $THIS_MC_FILE_NAME &gt; /etc/sendmail.cf
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Note: DON'T DO THIS using the sample I've given.  You'll
wipe out your existing sendmail.cf file!)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The idea here is not really that complicated.  sendmail uses
the cf file which is in a format that's convenient for the program.
For years people maintained cf files directly (using a text editor).
For some of us (myself included) it is still easier to make a small
change to an existing .cf file then it is figure out the corresponding
.mc file directive.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, most of the text in the .cf file looks like line noise.
So mere mortals among us prefer to create shorter files that summarize
what we want sendmail to do.  Then we pass these shorter .mc files
through a macro expansion tool (the m4 program) and they get expanded

<BLOCKQUOTE>
... but it's not clear.  Clearly your Linux box cannot be
receiving mail from the Internet if it's using a "private"
(non-routable RFC1918) IP address.  That is to say that you
can't advertise a 192.168.*.*, 10.*.*.* or 172.16.*.* through
172.31.*.* address to the Internet as your MX (mail exchanger).
If you did so, then no one would be able to route SMTP (or any
other IP traffic) to you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, it's possible that you could have a feature/rule on your
router such that it relayed any incoming traffic on TCP port 25
on eth1 (the outer interface) to the same port on your Linux box.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is one way to put a "hidden" server behind a router.  However,
it assumes that you have a router that is capable of doing such
relaying (or "transparent proxying").  There are a number of programs
capable of doing this for Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Another, less interesting and less useful solution would be for
your ISP to act as a your MX record AND for them to maintain their
own routes to your RFC1918 network.  Of course then you'd have to
co-ordinate this with your ISP and they'd have to assign different
RFC1918 address blocks to each of their customers that wanted this
service, and you'd have to maintain split DNS, and ... anyway
forget I mentioned that).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another option would be to use the Linux box <EM>as</EM> both the
router and the sendmail host.  This is possible (so long as you
can connect your ISDN modem or TA to your Linux box).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet another option would be to have your ISP give you more than
one static IP address.  Two would be sufficient; four would be a
relatively normal subnet, though only two would be usable in
that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: most of these configurations are NOT recommended.  They
offer little or no protection for the sendmail boxes, and
nothing protects your internal network from a potentially
compromised sendmail box.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a reasonable configuration.  You still need to
have some way of routing traffic to the Linux box.  That can
still be a TCP relay utility or feature running on the router
and redirecting all inbound SMTP (TCP port 25) traffic to
the Linux mail host.  It could be a different DRIP (directly
routable IP address) from your ISP.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It could even be a hack where all your incoming mail gets
stored by your ISP and is fetched into your domain via
POP or IMAP.  (I suspect that this is the way you were doing
it when you were in dial-up.  I suppose it might be what you're
still doing; it's not clear from your message).  Another trick
is for your ISP to be your primary MX, and for them to relay
it to you via UUCP (over TCP).

Basically just insert it between the network and the router.  Does that make
sense?  Here's the reason for the router being on the end...it has my ISDN
modem built-in.  It's the only device I have that can run the ISDN
connection.  Things are too $tight$ to get a nice connection like a T1 with
expensive firewalls and such, so I'm trying to make this work cheap!  I also
want the logging and auditing provided by the proxy.

The problem here is getting the incoming traffic to your Linux
box.  I'm guessing that you might have something like a Trancell Webramp
ISDN TA/router.  You could replace that with an ISDN card or an external
ISDN "modem" (which connects to your Linux box via a serial port).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In those cases you'd have the routing and mail services running on
a single system (which is not a good security profile since a
compromise of your mail host constitutes  a loss of control of
all of your routing).

The final effect is, a second "private" network between the linux box and
the router. So I will have one subnet for the LAN in general and eth0 of the
box on that side.  A second private address space and "subnet" available
only between eth1 and the router, and then of course our static IP on the
outside.  To me it kind of resembles a "DMZ" which most modern routers have
built in.  Let's call it a poor man's "DMZ".

Does this sound off the wall?  Every "how-to" I find for using Linux as a
firewall talks about it being the "router" at the end of the line between
the LAN/WAN.  I haven't heard of it being used as I have described and I'm
really not sure where to go from here.  It all sounds good on
paper..."...Client on the net ships a packet off to the gateway (eth0)...The
linux box runs it's firewall/proxy voodoo magic stuff and ships it out the
other side (eth1) to the router which of course really ships it out...".
But how about on the return trip?  With the firewall and the router both
using NAT...the router won't care, but how about inside the linux box?  Will
the packets still back and forth to each client OK?

... where you have three ethernet interface in your Linux Router
(a three legged firewall).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: this could be an ether crossover cable between the ISDN
router and the Linux box, or it could be a serial connection
between the Linux box and an external ISDN modem/TA (terminal
adapter) or the whole thing could be replaced with an internal
ISDN card that's plugged into the Linux Router.  (In that last
case, think of this line as being the Linux Router's internal
PCI or ISA bus).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The advantage here is that all traffic passes through the Linux
Router (where you can do packet filtering, IP redirection, logging).
However, if the Mail Server gets compromised then it can't be
easily used to attack the LAN machines.  (The mail server is not
trusted by the LAN machines, it is only allowed to received outbound
mail, and POP or other mail fetching connections from ther internal
hosts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can also sequester other services on the Linux Server.  You can
put a DNS server on it, etc.  Note that each service that you run on
the Linux Server the greater the risk that one of those services can
be used as a whole through which an attacker can compromise that
machine.  So, if you run mail, DNS, web and FTP all on that one
Linux server, then any exploit in any one of those can affect
the whole server, and thus compromise all of your DNS, mail, web,
and FTP services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's why we don't run those services on the router.  On my
router at home, there are NO services running (not even ssh).
I cannot access it remotely.  I must sit at the keyboard and work
from the console directly.  In fact there are IP packet filtering
rules that prevent that system from accepting <EM>any</EM> packets that
are addressed to it.  You can't even ping it!  (It will only
permit traffic that is supposed to go <EM>through</EM> it, not <EM>to</EM> it).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You could hang as many seperate Linux servers off of this eth2
interface (DMZ network segment) as you like.  However, you'll
either need to have separate real IP addresses (DRIPs) for each,
or you'll have to configure the Linux router to do TCP and UDP
redirection for each service to each server.

Actually your question is reasonably sophisticated, and your
criticism of the HOWTOs is well taken.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The biggest issue here is that you have two different problems
to solve.  First you need routing to work.  You need more IP
addresses or you need to install some form of TCP/UDP redirect
utility.  Keep in mind that the TCP/UDP redirect utilities might
be running as 'root' (if they are listening on "privileged" ports)
and, therefore might be a security risk <EM>on the router</EM>. There's a
way to use IPChains to redirect TCP traffic into a Unix domain socket
and I think there should be a utility to relay connections from
a Unix domain socket back to a TCP connection.  However, I haven't
looked for one recently and I don't remember if there was one the
last time a question like this came up.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(The advantage of this approach would be that it would allow the
redirection utilities to run as "nobody", or (better yet) as a
set of mutually non-trusting "nobody" UIDs --- which minimizes
the risk to the router).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's why the router in a firewall is called a "bastion."  You
want it to be relatively simple with as few windows, doors as
possible and NO ornamentation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I currently have a block of IP addresses, so I haven't had to
resort to incoming IP redirection.  (Otherwise I'd tell you the
name of the utility that I was using).

I reboot.  I would like to have this run at start everytime.  As  I

it changes user after initialization.  The documentation mentions how the
program will respond after being automatically started, but gives no mention

See if Mandrake uses the System V init scheme like <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> and <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>
do.  You have one directory containing start/stop scripts, and other
directories containing symlinks to those scripts.  On Debian (which I'm
familiar with), the script directory is <TT>/etc/init.d</TT>, and the normal
symlink directory is <TT>/etc/rc2.d</TT> .  In that directory, put a link called
S##squid pointing to the script.  (Replace "##" with a 2-digit number
indicating which order to run it--lower numbers get started first.)
Mandrake is probably the same but the directories may be named
slightly differently.

Look for a README in the script directory, <TT>/usr/doc/sysvinit</TT>,

I haven't actually used a tape drive, but I've never seen any that are
mountable in the way floppy disks are.  So you don't need an entry in
fstab.  (If you did, it would be
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><pre>/dev/DEVICE    /mnt/N    FILESYSTEM_TYPE   OPTIONS   0  0

You would especially want the "noauto" option to prevent it from
automatically mounting the tape at boot time.  (Which would cause an
unpleasant delay if there was no tape in the drive.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

But as I said, I doubt you can mount tapes at all anyway.

Normally, you must figure out which device it is, and then use that as
the "filename" argument to your backup program (e.g., tar).  E.g.,

You use the "mt" command to skip forward or backward

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hi all,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This weekend, I decided to load <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> Linux 6.4 onto my son's IBM
PS/ValuePoint computer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The network configuration is illustrated below.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have NFS running on my Linux machine, so I decided to install Linux
onto the IBM machine via NFS. I installed a minimal system so that I
could install user accounts in case problems occurred when I added more
packages to the system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once I had a minimal system up and running, I decided to use YAST (the
installation program) to added more packages into the system.
Everything worked fine until I was prompted to install CD2 of the
distribution.  I was told that I was loading the wrong CD!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I investigated the problem by executing "tcpdump" on my Linux machine so
that I could observe traffic over the ethernet.  To my surprise, I found
that the IBM machine was being denied access to CD2 (the second CD of
the SuSE distribution).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I then logged in as a user (not root) and then changed myself to root
with the 'su' command.  This allowed me to mount remote filesystems
using NFS (for example:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
I decided to continue observing ethernet traffic while I manually (for
example: mount <TT>-t</TT> nfs stargate:/cdrom myMountDirectory, where
myMountDirectory is a local directory on host strikeforce).  I now had a
controlled experiment, and I was able to determine that, out of the 6
CDs supplied with SuSE 6.4, CD number 2 could not be viewed, and this
was confirmed by the denied access packets observed via tcpdump on host
stargate.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It turned out that, on CD number two the directory "." only had root
priviledges.  On the other CDs, there existed read and execute
priviledge for group and world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My solution was to copy the image of CD2 onto a top level directory of
my Linux machine (host stargate), make sure that group and world had
read and execute rights, and modify <TT>/etc/exports</TT> (the NFS export file
which allows other users to view your filesystem) to reference the
directory.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The lines in <TT>/etc/exports</TT> looks like this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>--------------------------------------- start of file ----------------
# used for all other CDs
/cdrom    strikeforce(ro)
# used for CD number 2
/test/cdrom  strikeforce(ro)
--------------------------------------- end of file ------------------
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I noticed one odd thing during this exercise (installing Linux via NFS).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even though host strikeforce had unmounted the remote filesystem on
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
host stargate (I confirmed this via a telnet session onto host
strikeforce), I could not unmount my cdrom.  In order to unmount the
cdrom, I had to comment out the line, in <TT>/etc/exports</TT>, which refers to
<TT>/cdrom</TT>, restart the NFS server by typing "nfsserver restart", and then
typing "unmount <TT>/dev/cdrom</TT>".  I could then unmount the cdrom, change the
cdrom, mount the new cdrom, uncomment the abovementioned line in
<TT>/etc/exports</TT>,  and restart the NFS server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Perhaps, you do not have to unmount cdroms before changing them, but, I
would think that you would have to in order to maintain the proper
notion of the contents of the mounted cdrom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The bottom line: My copy of SuSE Linux 6.4 does not have group and world
access rights to CD number 2, thus, you have to install from an image
copied onto the hard disk of the NFS server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Perhaps this message is too long winded (I tend to ramble) for a 2 cent
tip.  I'll let all of you decide if this message is worth posting.  All
I know is that if I did not have strong networking and protocol
experience (my NFS knowledge is questionable), I wouldn't have known how
to use tcpdump, and I wouldn't have solved the problem in the speedy 5
hours that it took me.

Hey there gang!  I was in the Air Force for almost 21 years and worked in
the intelligence career field.  Depending on the level of classification the
overwrite method is not always allowable.  Shane Welton needs to contact his
security manager for clarification.  I took several computer security
courses taought by the NSA (yeah, I know the None Such Agency) and they
would not allow overwriting because they were able to recover all the data.

Heh. When I was in the Military Intelligence (yep, it's a non-sequitur
like "giant shrimp"), we dealt with NoneSuch; their "set in stone because
we say so" policies provoked a lot of comment among my fellow soldiers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The ability to recover data through a simple format is the reason for the
7X overwrite method with random garbage. As long as 15 years ago, I
remember there being a guy in California who had a SQUID (Super-Conducting
Quantum Interference Detector) that could pull up a relatively high
percentage of data from a hard drive that had been through six low-level
formats (of course, he charged a few pennies for the privilege - $60k was
the figure I heard.) Those are typically just overwrites with all zeroes,
and he simply had to dig for a faint-but-present remainder of the original
ones and zeroes. He would try, but did not promise anything, with a
<EM>single</EM> data overwrite (I believe he was relying on the blank spots in the
current data.) After seven overwrites with random bits, there's <EM>nothing</EM>
of the original data left to be read - there's absolutely no way to
distinguish a '1' written seven overwrites ago from a '1' two overwrites
ago.

<blockquote>

If that's true, why not just overwrite seven times with all "0" or all
"1", on alternating passes?  Or run "badblocks <TT>-w</TT>" which writes
all 0xaa, 0x55, 0xff, then 0x00, several times?  Seems like it'd
be a lot faster than waiting for entropy on the <TT>/dev/*random.</TT>  And,
it guarantees that every bit gets flipped multiple times.

&lt;Shrug&gt; I always thought it would be sufficient, but the government spec
requires randomness. Given that "<TT>/dev/urandom</TT>" is non-blocking, I can't
see it as being much slower than any of the above, and I believe that a
pseudo-random source still qualifies - but given that my familiarity with
the pertinent regulations is from many years back, Your Mileage May Vary.

since in a prior life i was a machinist (my dad owned a machine shop) to be
able to take a hard drive apart, chuck up the drive platter and remove the
top .030 (thirty thousandths) on each side AND then we had to smash the
platter.  The easiest thing was to just box up any drives and have the
courier take them up to Fort (Fumble) George G. Meade for them to destroy.

A so-called "split DNS" arrangement will do that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each subnet runs its own DNS server, which considers itself
authoritative for your domain.  Each server forwards other
requests to one or more third servers, possibly those of your
ISP, which handle all other requests.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The server on subnet #1 has entries in its zone table
only for hosts on subnet #1, and for any outside
hosts belonging to your domain that need to be reachable
from subnet #1.  Likewise, subnet #2.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Assuming your local subnets are 192.168.1.0 and .2.0
and that your ISPs nameservers are 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2,
with BIND-8.2, your boot file (often <TT>/etc/named.conf</TT>),
has stanzas containing:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>options {
        directory "/var/named";
        allow-query { 192.168.1.0/24; 127.0.0.1; };
        notify no;
        allow-transfer { none; };
        datasize 20M;
        forward only;
        forwarders {
        10.0.0.1;
        10.0.0.2;
        };
};

zone "your.domain." IN {
        type master;
        file "your.domain.zone";
};
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
along with any other options and stanzas you need.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"<TT>/var/named/your.domain.zone</TT>" on each subnet lists <EM>all</EM> hosts
belonging to your domain that are visible from that subnet.
This includes any hosts off the subnet, as this setup will not
query the third-party DNS for hosts it doesn't know about in
your domain.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Substitute the proper IPs.  Subnet #1 lists 192.168.1.0 network
in its allow-query field; subnet #2, 192.168.2.0.  Hosts
on each subnet point to their own nameserver.  If the subnet is
large enough to warrant the effort, set up two nameservers on each
subnet, the second a slave to or a mirror of the first, so the
subnet won't be left without name service if you have to take
the nameserver down.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have only one Linux server to implement this with,
run two copies of BIND, each listening only on the IP connected
to its respective subnet.  Use the "listen-on" directive for that;
for more information, see "man named.conf.5".

However you gain support for modern hardware (including CD's, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD and DVD-RAM) and procotols (running DV under a TCP/IP stack used to be like waltzing with a bear in a china shop!). You also lose all problems with memory management (forget about conventional vs. EMS and "largest program size").

Sorry to run a mite late, but you can easily consider Tom's Root Boot (it
runs off a floppy, needs no graphics whatsoever, and lives in RAMdisks) or
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> base (the install is a bit annoying, tho) - I think <A HREF="http://www.libranet.com/">LibraNet</A> can give
you a somewhat easier Debian setup without attempting to use graphics.

TomsRtbt is a libc5 based Linux system.  Tom Oehser says he lives in it
day to day, and I assume he is able to use a compiler in it, since he creates
the code for new small utilities on his disk. It <em>does</em> have networking.

The advantage of Debian would be the ability to use their apt-get package
manager to fetch new applications or languages if you need them, eg. Lisp,
scheme, etc.  The full-screen textmode utility 'console-apt' is also worth
the time to download, since you can use that to read descriptions of packages
that you're considering.

Does anyone know how to create a bootable DOS partition on a hardisk

</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

First, the DOS partition has to be a primary partition (one of the first four
partitions).  Exactly one partition should be marked 'active' using fdisk.
This is the partition that will boot.  If the DOS partition is active, you
will boot only into DOS.  If your Linux partition is active AND you set up
LILO, or if you set up LILO on the master boot record, you can choose Linux
or DOS from the LILO menu.  See the LILO documentation in <TT>/usr/doc/lilo/</TT> or
thereabouts, and the LILO HOWTO and the other HOWTOs at 
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">www.linuxdoc.org</a>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Actually, there is a DOS program called loadlin that will allow you to first
boot DOS, then go into Linux, but usually people use LILO instead.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't know about FreeDOS, but in MS-DOS or you have to copy the system files
in order to make a bootable disk.  You can do that when you format the disk
by using the <TT>/s</TT> option to the DOS FORMAT command, or by using the DOS SYS
command to copy the system files from a disk that already has then (e.g., a
bootable floppy: &quot;<tt>SYS A: C:</tt>&quot
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">.  The required files are <tt>IO.SYS</tt>, <tt>MSDOS.SYS</tt> and
<TT>COMMAND.COM</TT>.  IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS are hidden files in the root of your C:directory (or A:\ on bootable floppies).  COMMAND.COM is the DOS shell that
gives you the C:\&gt; prompt.  Without these three files, the DOS partition is
not bootable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In Windows95, these same three files and commands are used, and bring up Win95
in MS-DOS mode (without the GUI).  For the GUI, you'll have to install Windows.
If you have the Windows installation files on a CD, you can copy them to the
DOS partition from Linux, boot DOS somehow, and then run the Windows SETUP.EXE
program.  You probably won't be able to use the CD-ROM from DOS without
Windows; that's why you'd need to copy the setup files to the hard drive first.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All bets are off with Windows 2000.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If this doesn't answer your question, tell us more specifically what the
problem is (what error messages you're getting, what partitions you have),
and that may help us give a better answer.

This is the biggest clue right here.  It should be an error message
saying (perhaps cryptically) why the mail is being returned. Also look
at the headers of the original message (which the error message will
hopefully include).  Every mail system the message passes through will
add a Received: line before the other Received: lines.  Did the message
go all the way to his ISP?  Can you write to his ISP's tech support
address or to <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@his-isp.com"
	>postmaster@his-isp.com</A>?  You need to determine whether it's
only his address that's failing or all addresses at his ISP.

If you are on a Linux system (which you are, right, since you wrote to

your computer and where it was sent to.

I'm not familiar with Citrix/ICA client, but a quick look at their website

Try creating an icon that runs "super halt". A number of people out there
don't like "super", but as far as I know, its security problems
(particularly the "buffer overflow" bug) have been fixed, and it is very
handy for something like this. "super" allows a user to run a specific
command as if they were root, which "halt" requires. When I did this
myself, initially, I was concerned about some possibility of creating a
problem by not exiting X directly, but then realized that it was simply an
old MS-Windows mental block: after all, "Ctrl-Alt-BkSp" kills X; what can
shutting down do that's any worse?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

If you always want to reboot after exiting X then just start X
with a script like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
#!/bin/sh
<BR>startx
<BR>exec /sbin/shutdown -r now
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... so any exit from X will then execute the next line of your shell
script.  I'm sure there are more elegant ways.  You might even want
to patch the X sources to use [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Del] as the "Zap"
key instead of [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Backspace].  I don't know of an option
to configure that.  However, I haven't even looked at XFree86 version
4.x yet!

I don't know how this would be any different from simply hitting
"Ctrl-Alt-Del", unless "ica-client" intercepts that. If it doesn't, simply
make sure that your "<TT>/etc/inittab</TT>" contains lines that look like this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
# What to do when CTRL-ALT-DEL is pressed.

Hint: if you make "halt" an alias for "super halt", everyone who is
authorized via "<TT>/etc/super.tab</TT>" will be able to shut down the machine
simply by typing "halt" in an xterm.

I find that most folks who apologize for their English - and yours is fine,

to be understood) than native english speakers who write in with things
like "dOOdz U got 2 hepl mE My proBlM nVIDIa caRD WhaT I dO noW?????????"
It's not even the kOOl or 3l33t slang, but simply the fact that they don't

I have a RedHat 6.1 box that we use for dial out internet
access using ppp at 19200 baud. We would like to increase
our bandwidth, but according to our ISP the only way we can
do this, due to their system, is to have two dial out
connections and multiplex them together or have one for
outgoing and the other for incoming.

Oh-oh. Time for me to put on The Curmudgeon Hat. The "baud vs. bps"
confusion is one of my Rant Topics (don't worry; it's a general rather
than a directed rant.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are indeed connecting at 19200 baud (and that is far from certain),
it means absolutely nothing - unless you're doing something like packet
radio stuff, in which case you'd be dealing with the raw numbers. "baud"
refers to the actual switching frequency of the modem, which, given the
communication protocols in use today, bears less and less relation to the
bps (bytes per second) transmitted or received - the only thing that we
really care about, as it is the "real" data transfer rate (barring some
esoteric considerations.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(By the way, doing a search for "bps baud confused" on Google produces
over 7,000 hits. Don't feel like you're alone.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's see... by using Deep Magic, I can see that you're coming out of (or
at least e-mailing from) the Great State of Texas. Chances are pretty high
that the average ISP down thataway will let you connect at speeds up to
56k (nominally, that is; 53k is the actual upper limit due to phone system
voltage restrictions, unless they've changed it and forgot to notify me 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
If your ISP is restricting you to something below that, changing your ISP
is probably the best bet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, all that out of the way - if you actually do want to multiplex two
modems, and your ISP supports the scheme - and according to what you've
written, they do, then, yes, Linux does indeed support modem multiplexing.
Take a look at the "eql" package in the distribution, as well as
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"<TT>/usr/src/kernel-source-&lt;version&gt;/Documentation/networking/eql.txt</TT>"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
in the source tree. (This assumes that you have the kernel source
installed.) Note that modem multiplexing of this sort does not decrease
your latency, which is an entirely different issue and has quite a lot to
do with perceived "speed" of communications.

Ah. 'sil.org' is in Texas, and I gather you're posting via their web/mail

Also
there is only one ISP in our area and for some reason or another

Well - sounds like load-balancing experimentation is not a hobby for you
but more of a necessity. I must say that I find it interesting that your
ISP supports EQL; I assume you realize that it has to be supported at both
ends. Since they are the ones who suggested it, they most likely do. I wish
you the best of luck.

<P><STRONG>
Hi;
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am currently a Windows 98ME user. I have recently started studying Linux
OS at Tech.
I am looking at installing Linux onto an old PC at home to start with before
looking at possibly
replacing my current OS later on down the track.
My old PC is a i386 with 8Mb of RAM and about 250Mb of HDD space.
I am about to ask some silly questions which I hope you may be able to help
me with.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Firstly, for such an old system, is there a Linux OS available for it? (with
or without a GUI)
Secondly, I have an old Linux OS (similar to the old MS-DOS 3.3 OS) which I
am playing with
and am looking at writing a script which will help me to do the following:
</STRONG></P>

<strong><ul>
<li> advise user of terminal
<li> advise user of others logged on
<li> make an ext2 file system on a floppy
<li> mount a floppy at a location /mnt/floppy
<li> unmount the floppy from /mnt/floppy
<li> display date
<li> create back up of users home directory to floppy
<li> display current directory
<li> exit menu script.
</ul></strong>
<P><STRONG>
Actually, I'm also going through some old books but they don't five examples
of how these scripts
should be approached. I'm hoping that if I can get an example, it will give
me more of an idea on how
Linux directory system operates.
It does appears that the floppy drive once mounted becomes part of the root
directory rather than remain
a seperate drive as in MS OS .
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would like to know more about Linux. I believe that in the next few years,
it will grow more competitive
and become a real alternative to Windows.
I also have a copy of <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 6.2 which I am looking at putting onto a spare
i486 with 16MB RAM
which I have in pieces.
I have been told however, that Mandrake 7.0 is a much easier alternative
when starting out in Linux.
I guess I'm looking for some help in determining which direction I'm going.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>

<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> can run easily in the limitation you described - its "base" only
uses about 60 Mb or so.  (might be less, I haven't really counted it).
Graphical setups cost a lot more space - you should avoid using weighty
applications like Emacs, the big environments like Gnome, K or the Office
Suites, because they will be very slow for you, if you even get them to fit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You probably want to investigate some of the specialty distributions listed
at Linux Weekly News (<a href="http://www.lwn.net/">www.lwn.net</a>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whichever distro you use for the 386, make sure that you are fairly minimal
about what you allow it to install.  You might even consider calling the
staff for the companies (in the case of corporate distributions like <A HREF="http://linux.corel.com/">Corel</A>
or Redhat) and asking them what is the minimum space they can be installed
in, and the minimum RAM that configuration will run with.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The 486 you describe has a better chance of using something fairly ordinary,
though you'll probably still want to be picky about how to use your disk
space.  Again, 16 Mb is okay but a bit low, so the weightier apps won't be
all that happy in it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mandrake is a nice distro (when it works at all in your system) but since
it is optimized for 586 or higher-powered processors only, it won't work on
either of the two systems you mentioned.  Sorry.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have to, you can always use a much earlier distribution (though it
will have the security bugs that plagued those releases) or you can use a
"mini" distribution - usually optimized for running from floppies, but many
of them can be carefully set up to run from hard disks as well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Tom's root boot is a nice tiny distro (floppy based) to use to learn more
about things under Linux without getting too complex.  It runs from RAM so
you don't have to ruin any harddisks until you decide what you want to do.
Of course, its documentation is very minimal, because too much wouldn't fit
on a floppy.  You can find his work at <A HREF="http://www.toms.net/rb"

The card that you have has actually come up before in The Answer Guy column,
in issue 31.  (<A HREF="../issue31/tag_trident.html">linuxgazette.net/issue31/tag_trident.html</A>) It's been
supported in <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> (at least on a hardware list) since at least version
4.2.  So, the card's been around awhile, and we can at least assure you that
it works for Linux...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfortunately that's not what you've asked.  Sadly, we have no particularly
great idea where to find just about anything specific for Windows (any
revision)... that's not the OS we write about.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I do find an occasional gem for Windows (when I have to go looking)
at either winfiles.com, or TUCOWS.  That's short for: The Ultimate Collection
Of Windows Software.  They've of course spread out into more OS flavors and
hardware such as Palm pilots andd our fave, Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under Linux, the card you mention works under Xfree86 version 3.3.6 as well
as the new, restructured to be nice and fast, 4.0.  I even saw a mention of
a 64-bit version of it being okay (AGP wasm't mentioned over in the list at
www.xfree86.org, but I'm guessing that's what you really have).  Metro-X has
a commercial server for it too.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Though it's mentioned in scattered references as "unsupported" I have to add
that in Linux terms, that means Trident has been worthless in helping us use
their stuff, so it doesn't mean exactly that it doesn't work, it means that
we probably are not making the card behave at its very best.  We might be -
we might even do a better job than your missing Windows drivers - but we
really can't tell.  Not a lot of developers will throw extra money at more
pieces of unusable hardware if they should fry one while trying to code things
to make it work.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To be utterly fair to Trident, there aren't that many companies that are
"supported" in the sense of really giving us data that we can use for coding
up new X server support.  It's kind of strange that vendors won't help, even
with some raw information about expected input and output signals, since they
claim they want to sell hardware.  Even if it would somehow reveal some great
secret about their hardware (I find this difficult to believe), you don't see
very many companies helping us out even with their <EM>older</EM> cards, saving juicy
protectionism for the Hottest New Toy.  There are a few...  <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> and Precision
Insight have given a lot of extra help to the X Free86 project by helping
convince and aid vendors in going our route... as for the others, too bad for
them.  We tend to buy what we can use, and we're really good at friendly word
of mouth for helpful vendors.  So if things don't work out for you (though I
hope they do), allow me to recommend 3D Labs, ATI (we handle so many ATI cards
I stopped counting them.  Get a Rage 128 and save yourself from wondering
which server entry to pick), Matrox (Milleniums are excellent), 3Dfx, or any
of the other vendors who've done XFCom servers.  They can use the

You can use the ISP's DNS services.  Put internal hostnames in
the <TT>/etc/hosts</TT> files, or equivalent for other OSs, and point
all hosts to the ISPs nameservers for resolution of external
hosts.  On Linux, <TT>/etc/host.conf</TT> should read
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>order hosts,bind
multi on
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
and <TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT> should have:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>search your.internal.domain
nameserver IP.for.your.ISPs.nameserver
nameserver IP.for.another.of.your.ISPs.nameserver
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"your.internal.domain" is whatever you call your network.  No need
for it to be a registered domain.  "IP.for.your.ISPs.nameserver"
is the IP number for your ISP's nameserver.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It becomes worthwhile to set up an internal nameserver when
the internal network grows large enough to make propogating
the <TT>/etc/hosts</TT> files (and equivalent) a nuisance.  There are
a couple of other reasons to set up internal nameservers ...
consigning external banner ad servers to oblivion, for example ...
but AFAIK, these are all amenities you can easily live without.

Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am sorry about the interruption. But I have no way to find a help except
to try my luck everywhere I can (at least that's what I perceived). I have a
RH 6.2 server running as FTP server. Upon customer response, I will have to
send certain syslog message to their LAN account, like say <em>admin@system.com</em>.
I have read all the manual and even posted up a question on the linux
mailing list, but I have still no receiving the answer I want ... I now how
to redirect to a file or a local user, but this users is not a local system
users (but stay in the same domain), do you mind to guide me on this ??

I'm not exactly sure of what you're asking, but here is my best guess:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
1) You have a user connecting via FTP.
2) On a response (What kind of response? What kind is <EM>possible</EM> via
FTP?), you want to send e-mail to that user.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Assuming that the response - however it's done - contains the user's name
and host, the answer is an easy one:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
tail /var/log/messages | mail -s "Your syslog info" <A HREF="mailto:Username@Host"
	>Username@Host</A>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The above, for example, would send the last 10 lines of
"<TT>/var/log/messages</TT>" to the specified user. You can, of course, specify
whatever information you want to send, and use whatever subject you want
(the '<TT>-s</TT>' switch on the above command line) - this is purely an example,
since you didn't say what it is that you wanted from the syslog. Note that
you may have a decision to make with regard to file permissions, as most
log files are only readable by 'root'.

Read the man pages:

<blockquote><pre>RUNSCRIPT(1)                                         RUNSCRIPT(1)

NAME
       runscript - script interpreter for minicom

SYNOPSIS
       runscript scriptname [homedir]

DESCRIPTION
       runscript  is  a  simple  script  interpreter  that can be
       called from within the minicom communications  program  to
       automate  tasks  like  logging in to a unix system or your
       favorite bbs.
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
runscript is a utility that comes with minicom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, I can't just leave it at that.  That would be far
too simple an answer.  I really have to put in a plug for
Kermit if you're going to be doing any serious communications
scripting.  Kermit is a rich programming/scripting language for
automating serial and network communications.  I really suggest
that you try it instead of minicom's runscript.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I must admit that I usually use minicom for most of my simple
interactive serial terminal needs.  However that's purely born of
laziness. Minicom is included with most LInux distributions while I'd
have to fetch kermit and build it from sources.  If it was
"apt-get'able" from the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> archive system; I'd go back in a
heartbeat.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of that aside, runscript can probably do what you need,
and if that doesn't give you enough power to do the job then
look at the 'expect' programming language from Don Libes.  That
can automate any terminal/curses appllication under Linux/UNIX
and it supports the full TCL programming language.  There is also
an "expect.pm" module for PERL if you prefer its syntax and features.

Kermit is very good but their is one problem, i cant put AT commands in my

i have the same problem in minicom (it dowsnt recognize AT commands)
i try even to combine the both (minicom and kermit).

Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm a totally newbie about Linux, but I found it a real great OS (I
normally used Win98 !!!), but I have a small problem. I have just changed
my printer, a brand new Epson Stilus Color 670, but my Linux box won't use it
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

The main reason, Neo, is - of course - that the Matrix has you.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Generally, I would not respond - few people would - to a request for help
that gives so little useful information. The reason that I'm answering this
question at all is because printing setups can be troublesome, and what I
want to do here is write a sort of a mini-troubleshooting guide. "My Linux
box won't use it" is rather useless; what does that mean? Are you
physically unable to connect the printer to the box? Does it not fit on the
same desk as the computer? Does it print perfectly except for skipping
every other comma? There is no way to tell, and most of us aren't into
guessing. Please try to make yourself clearer when asking for help; there's
no such thing as "too much information" when doing so.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If there's one bit of advice that I'd want to emphasize to the newcomers
in the Linux community, this would be it - make yourself as clear as
possible when asking for help, and include as much information as you
think necessary... and then add some more.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- ::
Check the hardware for compatibility.
~~~
:: -->
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A quick check of Epson's website didn't give me any specs on this printer,
just advertising crud. I suspect, though, that it is not a WinPrinter -
that's what I wanted to check up on. If it was, you'd have a bit of trouble
(software is available, but it's problematic.) In any case, WinPrinters
are beyond the scope of what I want to cover. We'll assume that you have a
real, honest-to-goodness printer with its own brain, and go from there.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- ::
Test the hardware at the lowest level of complexity.
~~~
:: -->
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once you have connected the parallel cable (once again, USB printers are
outside the scope - look up the USB-HOWTO on the Web), powered up the
machine and the printer (DO NOT connect or disconnect parallel peripherals
under power: you stand a high chance of frying the peripheral and the
machine), and made sure that the printer's power light is on, it's time
for the basic test. Pick a text file that is about 1k in size - the
default "<TT>/etc/inittab</TT>" is a pretty fair example - and shove it straight out
through the parallel port:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
cat /etc/inittab &gt; /dev/lp0
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This assumes two things: 1) that you are logged in as root, and 2) that
the first parallel port, "lp0" (known as "LPT1:" under DOS/Windows) is
where your printer is connected.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If this doesn't work, look at any error messages that may be generated:
"Permission denied" probably means that you *didn't* log in as root.
"Device not configured" would mean that you either don't have the "lp"
module loaded (check by typing "lsmod") or do not have the kernel
parallel-port driver enabled, which would be a strange thing to do (but
I've seen it happen.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If no error messages are generated and there's still no output, try
assuming that it's the other parallel port - there are rarely more than
two on machines today; for that matter, more than one is becoming rare.
Anyway, try
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
cat /etc/inittab &gt; /dev/lp1
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
- it can't hurt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One rare, odd thing that can make this test fail - check the parallel port
settings in your BIOS. I've seen an "ECP/EPP" setting disable a Brother
printer under both Linux and Windows; all other settings allowed it to
work. Yes, Brother printers are weird - but this was about as strange as
snake suspenders...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If none of the above works, check the hardware by booting into DOS or
Windows and printing from there. If you still can't get it to print,
there's a problem with your hardware - port, cable, or printer. Curse life,
weep loudly, and replace whatever is necessary.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- ::
Setting up the printer spooler.
~~~
:: -->
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Install "lpr" or "lprng". For a home user, it makes no difference which
one you choose. Either one handles the tricky bit with the permissions -
you don't have to be root to print anymore. "cupsys", available with the
new version of <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> (and probably other distros) takes care of this and
the next (filtering) stage. Make sure your "<TT>/etc/printcap</TT>" is correct (see
"man printcap") and test the system by typing
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
lpr /etc/inittab
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- ::
Setting up print filters.
~~~
:: -->
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If all you were going to do is print text, you'd be done at this point.
However, most folks like their graphics and want to pretty-print stuff
like Web pages, etc. For this, you need a series of "translators" that
accept an arbitrary file type and turn it into language that is
appropriate for your printer. "magicfilter" and "apsfilter", in my
experience, can both be rather fussy about installation - I've had
problems with both. Test the system by printing a <EM>small</EM> graphics file,
preferably something like a black 4x4 pixel GIF or JPG - if you only get a
dot (the correct output), try a larger image; if the filters are messed
up, you won't get more than a page of random garbage.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At this point, you're done. The next move, as the original Neo said, is up
to you.

Is Xwindows a generic

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

"Linux" refers only to the kernel.  All Linux software comes from third
parties, including stuff that's necessary to boot and produce a shell
prompt.  X-windows is just a protocol; Xfree86 is a concrete
implementation of that protocol.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather]
Actually strictly speaking, X is the protocol, windows are what it is about
painting, and people rarely see them apart unless they are programming an
X based application.  Especially if they're programming a window manager;
window managers (whose names often end in wm: fvwm, qvwm, twm, flwm, icewm;
but not necessarily: blackbox, enlightenment, sawfish) are responsible for
listening to X protocol messages like "you got clicked" or "keystroke M" or
"please repaint coordinates so-and-so" and telling the right applications
what to do.  It's the window manager that owns the scrollbars, the title
bar, and the background.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Mike]
XFree86 describes itself as "a non-profit organisation which produces
XFree86, a freely redistributable open-source implementation of the X
Window System that runs on UNIX(R) and UNIX-like (like Linux, the BSDs,
Mac OS X (aka Darwin) and Solaris x86 series) operating systems and
OS/2."  (<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org"
	>http://www.xfree86.org</A>)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Linuxers adopted Xfree86 over other versions of X-windows because (1) it
runs on the x86 CPUs (a sine que non), (2) it's affordable (back when X
was unusable under Linux I almost bought BSDi [another UNIX-like OS]
instead, but didn't because of its price tag), and (3) meets our
standards for open source (not counting a few minor squabbles along the
way).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Linuxers chose X-windows over other graphical systems (e.g., MGR)
because almost all the graphical applications available for UNIX are
designed for X.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

There are other implementations of X, also... tinyX is one.  You can read
far more than any of us can say here by following some of the links at
Kenton Lee's site:

Four other graphical "systems" to look at are the framebuffer, SVGAlib,
Berlin and GGI.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The framebuffer is an optional part of the Linux kernel
that runs the video card in graphics mode.  This is required for
non-Intel systems (which don't have a text mode, so it must be
emulated).  It's also useful on Intel because X-windows normally takes
control of the video card itself, and because X is such a huge beast,
buggy X programs and drivers can crash the X server, freezing the
screen+keyboard+mouse and necessitating a reboot.  But with the
framebuffer, the kernel retains control of the video card and can tell
the X server where to go.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
SVGAlib is a library that allows non-X programs to use graphics mode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather]
However, there's only one fellow in charge of it and video cards keep moving
onward.  Last I saw, he's not adding support for new cards - although many
with VESA 2.0 compatability will work.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

Berlin is/was a project to make a windowing system better than X.  I
can't find a URL for it, so I'm not sure if it still exists.  (I thought
it was www.berlin.org, but that goes to www.berlin.de, which contains
tourist information about the city.  Google and MetaCrawler don't seem
to have any links to it.)

The trick is to make sure you don't get references to the city, by putting

GGI ("General Graphics Interface",

I'll let others answer these since I don't know.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather]
I don't think that is the case... although certain video chips may get a
significant boost from having OpenGL support directly, Mesa is software that
allows non-supporting cards to display applications designed around OpenGL.
Mostly.  The author is very careful to state that it is not a licensed SGI
implementation of OpenGL so if something isn't a perfect match, sorry.  You
can read all about that at the Mesa project homesite, again not quite obvious:
<A HREF="http://www.mesa3d.org"
	>http://www.mesa3d.org</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyways I hope that helps a bit.  Since I don't know what kind of nice graphics
you're trying to do, I don't know if any of the APIs optimized for helping
gamers might help you out too.  But this should be a good start.

Diald's main use is to automatically initiate a ppp connection when
there's outgoing traffic at your site but the link is down, and then
to tell ppp to hang up when the outgoing traffic has been idle for a
certain period of time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For an ordinary firewall situation with ppp and an analog modem, where
you want the connection to go up and down automatically as needed, yes,
you would use diald.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that diald cannot measure <EM>incoming</EM> traffic when the link is
down.  This would require something like diald at the ISP's end.

I don't know what you mean by "bulk friendly."  However, you should
be aware that the phrase carries very negative connotations to
experience internet professionals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To must of us that suggests that you are planning to spam (e-mail)
people and you want to hook up with an ISP that will tolerate your
abuse of the Internet and shield you from the wrath of the people
that you offend.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since you say it's a "very small website" I presume that you don't
mean that you have a "bulk" of content that you wish to make
available.  Perhaps you mean that you have a small volume of content
that you believe will get an immense amount of traffic.  Obviously
there are lots of ISP and co-location facilities out there.  For
commercial traffic they are <EM>very</EM> "bulk friendly" (since they
charge for all the traffic --- the more traffic you generate, the
more money they charge and the friendlier they get).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, I'll refrain from suggested actual companies here.  Among
other things I don't know enough about your needs and resources
(money) to make any reasonable suggestions, and I'm not in the
business of shopping for ISPs (bulk-friendly or otherwise).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I've left your name in this message since your
e-mail address is clearly and solicitation for relevant advertising.
I'm sure that "bulk friendly" ISPs will just be banging down your
inbox within a few days.  (Normally we filter e-mail addresses
out of LG Answer Gang articles to protect or correspondents from
spammers; however this appears to be a "trowaway" e-mail account
which will be abandonned as soon as you've made your selection
--- so I'll suggest to my editors that we make an exception in your
case).
