The Department of Homeland Security is funding the security of
open-source products, including Linux, <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>, MySQL <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, Mozilla,
and Sendmail.  I think this is a great use of public funds.  One of the
limitations of open-source development is that it's hard to fund tools
like Coverity.  And this kind of thing improves security for a lot of
different organizations against a wide variety of threats.  And it
increases competition with Microsoft, which will force it to improve
its OS as well.  Everybody wins.

I was talking about this sort of thing with a girl I know the other day. To <EM>really</EM> know a language, you have to know the popular culture in that language, the kinds of things kids learn, etc. To her credit, she has been reading some English-language fairy tales -- I can think of quite a few movies and books that would make absolutely no sense if you had never heard "Little Red Riding Hood", for example.

But perhaps not biased enough. I didn't see "50 W to L Y L", nor did I
see "1 is the L N". Even though I went to a school where rugby was
played (although my mission was to drink the beer), I missed that one
(and several others)

There certainly should have been "2 W on a P", in our context.

Not really. Many of the items were facts that most people should be able to recognise: 90 D in a R A, 24 H in a D, etc. Some were extremely culturally biased: I only figured out "6 B to an O in C" after Breen mentioned being on the wrong side of the pond for it

something to do with cricket, and 19 is some damn special version of

[LAUGH] Yeah. I got hung up on the whole Bible-related tone of the thing
for a while (how the heck would I know about that stuff, other than just
having basic familiarity with the context and the poetry of the thing?)

It's not usually the type of thing that I'm into - although this one was
fun. I used to do the NY Times crossword puzzle on the way to work when
I was living in Brooklyn. The train took 52 minutes (+/- a minute or
two) from my stop to 34th Street in Manhattan, and I could usually
finish it before I got off the train - although Fridays were <EM>tough</EM>
(about 50/50). I don't know if they still do this, but the crosswords in
NY Times used to get progressively harder throughout the week.

Got about half of them, the gave up/got bored. Tried to look in the
javascript to see what the answers were for the ones I missed, but they
were smart enough to use SHA1. But we know the first letter of each

Some entirely outrageous ones have been included in an effort to make
the test more "culture-inclusive". One of my friends discovered what
"9 P in S A" was and even with "Google Earth" or the equivalent I
wouldn't have ever known enough to answer that.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In fact, some of the culture-specific ones were easier for me because
I <EM>assumed</EM> that the author of these tests had a certain cultural bias
and factored that in into the guesses I made. So even though I didn't
<EM>know</EM> (e.g.) that there were "39 B in the O T" I could guess the
answer and then the web page (with JavaScript enabled) verified that
my guess was correct.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I liked the way the author of the tests had made them impossible to
cheat on. Maybe it is now standard practice for on-line tests but it
was a new one on me.

It's harder when they don't have the intelligence themselves to parse
the responses only for keywords.  If leaving out the number they put on
the prompt from the reply makes me wrong, I'm smarter than they are,

Ben, Vista is scheduled to launch at Christmas this year,right?
Do you think that is a coincidence?
By that time, "Vista-ready" computers (Micr0$0ft's recommended hardwareX2)
won't be all that uncommon,and Christmas shopping madness will do the rest.
Same story was when XP launched, what, 5 years ago?

It's the same old formula that Micr0s0ft has been using all along -
however, at this point, it's been turned on its head. Yes, the US is
where most of the computer buying power is - but the top of the market
is by far not the only buying public out there. Neither Joe Average in
Chicago nor his cousin Giuseppe Averaggio in Milan (nor most of their
other relatives all over the world) can afford to just toss their
current system just because Micr0s0ft has decreed that they should;
aside from the expense, other considerations - e.g., the hassle of
installing all the new hardware, dealing with replacing anything that
fails to work, adapting to the new system, "upgrading" the software that
turns out to be non-compatible with their new OS - make it a very
low-percentage game. Yeah, there are new adopters all over the place -
but many of those have already installed Linux, anyway. Yeah, there are
companies that, for various (generally non-technical) reasons will
"upgrade" to Vista... but given the general awareness of Linux now, and
the fact that people realize that changing over is going to require
adapting <EM>anyway</EM>, there's a certain (and I believe, large) percentage
of people that will decide to get out of that game and switch to Linux.

This is besides the fact that there are more and more companies and

Arrogance will bury them, DRM and 'trusted computing' too.
Imagine Joe Average User trying to rip his S0ny 'enhanced' CD using WMP 11,
or installing 'unapproved' software to his brand new Vi$ta machine, and failing.
Imagine man realizing that he is 0wned and his freedom to do
whatever he bloody wants with things he payed for, taken away from him 'for his own good'.
Imagine his anger and frustration.
And then he hears of this Linux thing, which has its own quirks, but it's all about freedom.

There's a new American radio format like this, although it's
programmed rather than requests.  They have a large playlist of a wide
variety of rock genres (60s-00s), and they play them in a random order
even if it puts dissimilar songs next to each other.  Supposedly it's
popular because people are tired of the same old songs again and
again.  It was started by one network ("JACK FM") but there are other
stations doing it too.  The LA station has the most interesting
website:

I'm talking about metal influences on individual bands or the

This is something I am seeing a lot here too.  What I would class as
"good" music is being put in these so-called "bargain buckets" as a
quick sale.  Bands like 'Love' are always in there.  It's even more a
shame in that although 'Forever Changes' as an album is rated very
highly, it's also degraded -- it now has a label of being "passed its
time", simply because it's so common to see it in these bargain buckets.

The worst thing about listening to metal is that metal labels like

What's funny is, new wave albums will soon become collectors' items
and disappear from the record stores, and reappear on eBay for $100
each.  Even ones that you thought should never have seen the light of
day.  I thought a lot of used stuff like the Clash would always be
plentiful, but it has already disappeared into collectors' hands, at
least around here.  If I'd've known that, I would have kept all the
records I'd gotten rid of over the years.  I had all my CDs stolen in

I generally don't collect things for resale.  It's more a matter of
keeping things you'll never find again, that you're likely to want
later.  Or if you like a certain subculture, building up a "complete"
collection of used items over the years.   ("See!  I got all of this
used.  This one came from a thrift shop, this one from a garage sale,
this one a friend gave to me, this one I got while visiting England,
this one a friend brought me when he was visiting the US...")

But in the 80s and 90s I was moving a lot, so I was more interested in
being portable and lightweight than saving stuff.  In high school, My
cousin came to live with us with all her possessions in a Volkswagon,
and I thought, "Wow, that's cool."  I never managed that, my moves
went up from two pickup truckloads to four, but that's mainly coz I
have furniture now.  [1]  In high school (1982) I could always find
60s old album I wanted used, from Beatles to Kinks to Jefferson
Airplane, and I loaded up on Rush.  I just assumed that would always
be the case, so I unloaded anything I didn't have an immediate want
for.  But I didn't anticipate how short-lived the Industrial and
Ambient eras would be or how quickly the material would disappear.
Maybe it's just coz I moved from mainstream music to obscure music,
and that always happens with obscure music.

to get you a proper bed."  So she dragged him to the bed store.  He
told the clerk, "I've never shopped for a bed before.  How do you do
it?"  The clerk said, "Just lie down on several till you find one you
like."  So he did, and one bed was so comfortable it talked to him,
"Come to Henry!"  So he bought that one.  But he couldn't bear to get
rid of his beloved futon, so he kept it under the bed.

Here's one that might get past a number of people; other than the
way-too-crude XSS attack imitation, it's going to be rather effective
for a certain segment of the population.

About a day ago, Kat put up some of our boat cruft up on eBay. Last
night, I got this email:

Notice anything unusual? Here are a couple of things that sent up red
flags for me right away:
</STRONG></P>

<p><Strong><ol>
<LI>"Your registered name is included to show this message originated from eBay." Really? Where is it, then?



<LI>"This message was ! sent while" - I don't think that eBay formats their messages per the Jargon File.



<LI>"Respond to this question in My Messages" - these are supposed to be _my_ messages, and it shows an eBay.uk address? Uh-huh.



<LI>"This eBay notice was sent to kvnmtchll200@aol.com" - sure, I've been using AOL all my life; I've just been hiding it from my friends. [sob] I'll go kill myself with a plastic fork now!

</ol></Strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Best of all, though, is what happens when you load it up in a browser
(I'll include the HTML just so those who are interested can play with
it):
</STRONG></P>

<font color="#006600"><blockquote><IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Jimmy] Warning! Certain browsers try to render this!
</blockquote></font>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/nottag/phishing-source.txt">phishing-source.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
Take a careful look at that "Submit" button link:
</STRONG></P>

<pre style="font-weight: bold; color: red">&lt;A title=http://contact.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?M2MContact&amp;amp;item=4589070441&amp;amp;

sruproductsidfavoritenavmigrateVisitor/SignIn.html" target=_blank onfiltered="return ShowLinkWarning()"&gt;
</pre>
<P><STRONG>
So, the button is going to pop up a little label saying it's from
'ebay.co.uk'... but it will link to (and your bottom bar will show it
as) the 'www.varzavarzarau.go.ro' address. Clicking on it takes you to a
look-alike eBay login page... except that there are a couple of those
minor quirks, much like the page above, in it.
</STRONG></P>

Naivete costs money - and these days, it happens at Internet speeds.

Oh, to expand on the "XSS" bit: what made it crude is that it was
missing one of the critical components of XSS. If you look at the URL in
the address bar when the ostensible "eBay loging page" shows up, it's
that "www.varzavarzarau.go.ro" one, with a very long tail on it. In an
actual XSS attack, once you get that far in the process, there's almost
no way to tell - since you're actually at the page where you think you
are, but you're "piped through" someone else's machine.
