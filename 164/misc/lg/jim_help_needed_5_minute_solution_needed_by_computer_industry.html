<p>
Jim,
</p>

<p>
I'm looking for a "simple" client server solution.  I just want to 
upload files from my PC to my server under program control.
</p>

<p>
The client is Windows XP and the server is Linux.
</p>

<p>
I was recently forced to write a VB application to collect files on the 
Windows PC.  Now, I need to upload the files to my Linux server.  I 
usually use FileZilla, however, there is no easy accepted way to 
automate the queue building process in Filezilla, therefore manual 
intervention is still required.
</p>

<p>
I need to get rid of all manual intervention.
</p>

<p>
My old PHP applications had a custom server to server file transfer 
implemented.  So, I can use that solution on the server if the client 
were cooperative.  I setup up an Apache server on the PC client but 
dynamic DNS is no longer allowed by my ISP (as far as I can determine).
</p>

<p>
So, I started looking for a simple custom program solution.  VB.NET was 
my first choice since I can reuse alot of my recently developed code.
</p>

<p>
I've looked for days (weeks) now and tried 20 or so pieces of code that 
claimed to allow client to server file transfer.  None have worked so 
far.
</p>

<p>
So, the challenge is this - come up with a solution (preferably PHP on 
Linux and VB.NET on Windows) that a programmer can implement in five 
minutes that will upload a file from the VB.NET Windows client machine 
to the PHP Linux server machine.  I just want to copy the code and have 
it work.  I can't believe it's that hard!!!!
</p>

<p>
If you get something to work and document it well, I've got to believe 
millions of folks will be viewing your result.  The various search terms 
I use in Google to try to discover a solution indicate millions are 
looking!
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Bill

<p>
I can't help thinking this is a bit of a troll.
</p>

<p>
There are several solutions, but the easiest that comes to mind is to
use SAMBA as the server, and simply copy the file.

I suspect that you were trying to contact Jim Dennis. A number of years
have passed since then: Jim is no longer associated with LG (although
he's always welcome here), and the Linux Gazette now has The Answer Gang
instead of The Answer Guy. We do, however, still answer Linux-related
(and sometimes other) questions.

So... you're looking for a solution to a problem in a Windows
application, written in a proprietary (Windows-only) programming
language. So far, so good.
</p>

<p>
May I ask why you're asking that question of the <em>Linux</em> Gazette?
It does not seem likely to produce results.
</p>

<p>
Now, had you asked that question about a Linux application, the answer
would be trivial: e.g., a cron job that will run a shell script to tar
up a bunch of files and then FTP (or rsync, or whatever) the tarball
elsewhere. Case closed, problem solved.

<p>
So, Aviongoo Sales (some parents should be shot. I'm just sayin'.) - since
you are, theoretically, a VB programmer, why don't you study the language a
bit more, come up with a solution, and <strong>sell</strong> it to all those people
clamoring for a solution? Given that there are millions of them, you're
sure to make out quite well.

Hi Bill,
I'd go with rsync and a ssh connection with a pre-shared key. That you 
can easily trigger from various scripts and it builds the file list itself.
There are lots of howtos on the net or come back if you need more help,

Hi, Bill -

</p>

<p>
----- Forwarded message from Aviongoo Sales &lt;sales@aviongoo.com&gt; -----
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Ben,
&gt; 
&gt; I love PHP.  Unfortunately not all people do.
</pre>

<p>
I teach the stuff - just came back from a week of teaching an advanced
course at a major insurance company - and I don't love it at all. PHP
is, in my opinion, unforgivably buggy, has <strong>way</strong> too many functions and
way too little flexibility, makes it too easy to write bad code, and has
too few testing/validation tools. It's relatively easy to learn/use
initially, but it quickly runs out of power; it uses a horribly-broken
imitation of OO which is missing much of the point of OO methodology,
and it is responsible for more than a third of <strong>all</strong> vulnerabilities in
the National Vulnerability Database last year (it was almost <em>half</em> of
all vulns back in 2006.) The only way to make it even marginally better
requires using a closed-source app with a truly weird licensing scheme
(Zend), and even that solution is less than wonderful.
</p>

<p>
In essence, PHP reminds me of those brightly-colored ices that are sold
by ice cream trucks: they're pretty and sweet and pleasant on a hot day,
but in just a few minutes, they melt and run all over your clothes,
staining them forever with potentially toxic chemicals.
</p>

<p>
But that could just be the result of intense contact with it over the
past week. A month down the road, I'll probably have a somewhat milder
opinion of it. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I was forced into writing  
&gt; part of a solution using VB.NET on a PC to connect to my PHP software on a  
&gt; Linux server.
&gt; 
&gt; And, I've already cobbled together a solution to meet my personal needs.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the bigger issue remains the same.  Before I developed my own  
&gt; solution (I used command-line ftp code - MSDOS lives!!!!), I searched for a 
&gt; "PHP-VB.NET solution".  I can understand the Microsoft community not 
&gt; wanting to provide a solution, however, I can not understand why the PHP 
&gt; community would not document a solution!  Throughout my searches I have 
&gt; never discovered a "drop in the code and go" solution.
&gt; 
&gt; I even have an Apache server and PHP installed on my PC - but that solution 
&gt; does not work all the time.  For example, currently my ISP seems to have  
&gt; configured something so that Dynamic DNS does not work.
</pre>

<p>
Why not configure your PC to connect to your server via, say, SSH and
download the files that you want? At that point, it doesn't matter
whether DynDNS works or not; as long as you have network connectivity,
you'll have your files.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; So, in my mind it is a PHP community task to be able to talk to any client 
&gt; - after all, PHP is primarily for servers.  I especially think the PHP  
&gt; community is missing the boat by not providing a simple seamless solution 
&gt; to connect a Windows client to a Linux server.
</pre>

<p>
Why do you consider that to be something that PHP should do? This is
like saying that PHP should include a web browser: from some odd
perspective, that may sound reasonable (after all, PHP is designed to
work with the Web, it's a programming language, and so on), but in
reality, it makes no sense at all.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; That's why I mentioned a  
&gt; "5-minute" solution.
</pre>

<p>
What I've suggested above won't take much more than that - assuming that
you already have the tools installed on your machine.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Because these days when you want to get a project  
&gt; done, there is no time to search for hours for a solution.  You either find 
&gt; it from a search or build it yourself.  But, when you build it yourself, it 
&gt; is generally a custom solution.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you telling me that a simple solution to programmatically upload a  
&gt; single file from a VB.NET application to a PHP server is not somthing that  
&gt; would be useful to the PHP community?  I beg to differ!
</pre>

<p>
If VB.NET supports something like a 'system' call, then you're already
done. The PuttySSH site, for example
(<a href='http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/'>http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>) provides you with 
a Wind0ws version of 'scp'; that's really all you need.

<p>
Ben,
</p>

<p>
Sorry, but I have no idea what "We'd all really apreciate it if you didn't 
top post, either." means.  So, if I've done it again please explain.
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, trying to teach PHP as an object-oriented language is simply 
wrong!  PHP was not designed to be an object-oriented language and I do not 
use a CLASS in anything I develop.  And, most of the PHP code I see 
implemented by others is not object-oriented either.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand when an advertisement specifically asks for a PHP5 person, 
I always ask if they have ever implemented object-oriented PHP.  Often they 
are seeking a replacement for someone that has left them a whole bunch of 
PHP5 code they do not understand.
</p>

<p>
And, who in their right mind would use "-&gt;" for anything other than 
something to do with "minus" or "greater than"!!!!!  Whomever did that in 
PHP development was just not thinking.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I've been writing PHP code for well over a decade so there was no 
attempt at object-orientation back then.  I was previously a VB 6 programmer 
and before that I coded in ASM, BAL, Fortran, Algol, COBOL, APL, PL/I, C, 
C++ and several other languages.  Out of all the languages my favorite is 
PHP.  I love it because of all the functions that exist to do precisely what 
you need to accomplish.  I hate to reinvent the wheel.  I find PHP to be 
very flexible as a language on the server.  There is not a server-based 
application development project where PHP can not be used.
</p>

<p>
You said, "Why not configure your PC to connect to your server via, say, SSH 
and download the files that you want?".  The task I defined is UPLOAD not 
download.  Secondly, I guess I am still not explaining myself well.  I'll 
try again.  I'll explain it in terms of 1) what I want to accomplish, and 2) 
what I want to do to achieve what I want to accomplish.
</p>

<p>
1) I want to implement a file upload program where a custom PC-based 
application can determine and specify the file to be uploaded at a specific 
time without human intervention
2) I want to go to Google and enter something like "vb.net code to upload a 
file to Linux server" (without quotes).  I want working code to be displayed 
that I can copy and use.  I want to have a solution implemented within five 
minutes (300 seconds) and no more.
</p>

<p>
As I said, I already have a solution.  While I thank you for your "SSH" 
suggestion (I usually use PuTTY), and while I might develop a solution that 
uses SSH - your suggestion misses the point.  Using "SSH" in a google search 
"code for programmatic use of SSH to upload a file to Linux server" does not 
come close to presenting me with code I can use.
</p>

<p>
Seriously, the key point is this - I find it incredible that after entering 
numerous Google, Bing, and Yahoo queries similar to "vb.net code to upload a 
file to Linux server" and not a single one has produced a result where I can 
copy and paste working vb.net code or even old vb code.  When code was 
displayed it was usually in the form of a question i.e. "why doesn't this 
code work?".
</p>

<p>
I simply can not believe a working solution has not been documented and 
indexed in Google.  But it hasn't!
</p>

<p>
And that is why I thought the Linux community would be interested.  Since 
Linux is not close to replacing Windows client machines, at least Linux 
should want to make it easy for programmers to do basic client/server 
operations - such as implement a file upload under program control solution. 
I guess I was wrong that the Linux community would be interested.
</p>

<p>
PLEASE, ANYONE ON THIS LIST, DO NOT SEND ME A SOLUTION.  I already have a 
working solution.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Bill

<p>
I think the answer to this one is simple, most people involved in the
Linux community have a rather intense dislike for .NET based solutions.
I don't understand why anyone would want to code in such a horrendous
proprietary language which is completely useless away from Windows. I
don't think the Linux community has any interest in coding in vb.net,
hence why you won't be able to find a documented working solution using it.

I personally prefer the term "corporate-moron quoting style".  ;-&gt;

However, line order is actually by far the less-significant aspect.  The
need to snip pointless quotation -- i.e., to lose all quoted upthread text
except any bits actually needed as context for your individual comments
-- is really the key bit.  Even GMail users can accomplish that, albeit
with difficulty, using a feature I believe is commonly called "the

<p>
You are, unfortunately, incorrect on several counts.
</p>

<p>
1) Top posting is not the usual form of business email. It is, however,
the usual form of <em>clueless</em> email, business or otherwise (people who
accept the default settings of Outlook, for example, have this kind of
problem.)
</p>

<p>
2) It has nothing to do with archiving; frankly, Mailman doesn't care
whether you top-post, post sideways, or in multiply-reversing curlicues,
or even (the preferred approach on this list) if you reply according to
the Netiquette Guidelines (RFC1855). Text is text, and writing that text
out to a file is not influenced by any human-perceived order within it.
</p>

The actual problem with top-posting is that it breaks the continuity and
flow of the conversation: in order to find out who said what, and in
what order, you have to keep scrolling up and down repeatedly. People in
technical forums, at the very least, consider top-posting to be
extraordinarily rude, especially when asking for help. In fact, many
people simply refuse to respond to a top-posted reply, no matter how
urgent or pitiful it may sound. It is, therefore, strongly in the
interest of the person making the request to obey this basic rule of
netiquette.

own writing. A blank line between paragraphs - i.e., before you begin

&gt; &gt; And that is why I thought the Linux community would be interested. 
&gt; &gt; Since Linux is not close to replacing Windows client machines, at
&gt; &gt; least Linux should want to make it easy for programmers to do basic
&gt; &gt; client/server operations - such as implement a file upload under
&gt; &gt; program control solution. I guess I was wrong that the Linux community
&gt; &gt; would be interested.
&gt; I think the answer to this one is simple, most people involved in the

&gt; 1) Top posting is not the usual form of business email. It is, however,

I wouldn't completely rule it out offhand, it's useful if you wish to
keep a record of the entire conversation current for whatever purpose
but don't want the receiver to go wading through everything to find
whatever new information it is that you are adding to the scenario.

&gt; 2) It has nothing to do with archiving; frankly, Mailman doesn't care
&gt; whether you top-post, post sideways, or in multiply-reversing curlicues,
&gt; or even (the preferred approach on this list) if you reply according to
&gt; the Netiquette Guidelines (RFC1855). Text is text, and writing that text
&gt; out to a file is not influenced by any human-perceived order within it.

All of these posts are available on the net, are they not? I meant
merely that top posting would be even more inconvenient to read in an
online archive than it would be in an email client. Personally I don't
particularly mind if there's a bunch of junk after the meaningful
content in an email, but if I have to scroll past it in a forum style
layout, it's a right pain in the arse. I didn't mean that comment in any
technical sense, merely taking the lack of readability as implied and
extending from there. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Perhaps I was exaggerating with `most'. I'm sure the Mono community
would disagree, however to put the shoe on the other foot, Mono itself
leaves a bad taste in the mouth of many, with all the legal greywater
surrounding Moonlight and the use of it by anyone other than direct
Novell customers. Personally I have the utmost respect for the Mono guys
and hope they can bring a complete adaptation of the .NET platform to
Linux, as it will make any desktop applications (the Wizards of the
Coast D&amp;D 4e Character Builder springs to mind) on it that much more
easy to use for *nix customers. However, I don't really see the
advantage of using .NET for portable applications at this stage, when
one could sidestep all the legal issues and use something like Python,
which already exists on the three main desktop platforms.
</p>

<p>
That's getting kind of off topic, so, opinions of .NET aside, I don't
think `the Linux community' would be particularly interested in writing
code for Windows client machines. Linux server vendors might be, but
probably not the community at large. That's probably a better answer to
the original statement.

"Wading" is just a bit hyperbolic, there: either setting your email
client to place the cursor at the bottom of the email or holding the
"Page Down" key for a second gets you to where the new content needs to
be added. "Wading" would be having to scroll through all the previous
emails, <em>backwards,</em> in order to see that history that's supposed to be
so valuable.

There's a large number of things that will work fine on legacy OSes as
well as on Linux: Perl, PHP, even shell scripting given any one of the
Unix toolkits. In the past, we have often helped querents with Windows
questions by suggesting a Linux-but-will-work-anyway solution; these
serve the Linux community as well as helping the querent. "Aviongoo"
Bill clearly didn't want to hear anything like that; too bad for him, I
suppose. We <em>don't</em> provide "Windows-only" support.

As it so happens, there is a spate of attention around recent moves from
some of the Debian guys to include Mono in the Gnome distribution for
the latest Debian release.  The whole argument seems to be around the
Tomboy applet, which is a simple notebook like GNote.  For the privilege
of the Mono based Tomboy, you get an added 50MB of dependencies
introduced.  The size is a relatively minor issue though...
</p>

<p>
The argument for Mono seems to be: "It's open source, so it's ok".
</p>

<p>
What some people are missing with Mono, is that it is an implementation
of Microsoft's intellectual property, protected by numerous patents for
aspects of the .NET API, as well as patents against the C# language.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it would be pertinent to point out the recent action Microsoft
instated against TomTom GPS systems;  TomTom used Linux as the base OS,
but used the VFAT file system to access flash storage.  TomTom came to
an out of court settlement with Microsoft, and although the details of
the agreement are unavailable, one might speculate that this entails
either replacing Linux, or paying the royalty.
</p>

<p>
The same situation applies to future a Gnome desktop dependent on Mono.
How long before the first company is sued for royalties?
</p>

<p>
Why anyone would prefer C# over C/C++ for development is beyond me.

&gt; used to advocate the removal of Mono for (potentially) infringing
&gt; Microsoft patents: wouldn't that also advocate the removal of Linux
&gt; itself?
</pre>

<p>
The TomTom case is an example of Microsoft enforcing their intellectual
property rights.  Please understand that although many people infringe
on the FAT patent every day, Microsoft normally has no interest in
actually enforcing it.  Instead, it is in their best interest that FAT
usage becomes as ubiquitous as possible, and the de facto standard.
This leads to situations such as that where TomTom have no choice other
than to use FAT.
</p>

<p>
Far from being a "ridiculous example", the TomTom case has an
extrordinary bearing on Mono, and the adoption of C#.  FAT was
considered to be "free" for a great many years (around 15 years) until
MS patented it.  It is still considered by many to be free, but it is
not.  Just as with FAT, it is clearly in Microsoft's best interests for
DotNet &amp; C# to become as entrenched as can be.  Although Microsoft have
indicated that they will not "for now" be enforcing their C# and DotNet
patents, they have not relinquished their right to do so in future.
</p>

<p>
Implicit in your last question, is that Linux itself is so riddled with
instances of patent breach, that this should "advocate the removal of
Linux itself".  According to IP law, users of Linux would be liable for
royalty to Microsoft for the extent to which they use features made
available by Linux, which are covered by Microsoft patents.  This is
evidenced in the TomTom case.
</p>

<p>
This "Devil be damned" attitude towards the intellectual property rights
(patents, trademarks,logos,copyright) of others is a very dangerous path
for the open source world to travel.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I certainly wouldn't encourage anyone to trust Microsoft blindly, but
&gt; given their track record, I happen to think it's a good thing that
&gt; they're taking tentative steps into the worlds of open standards and

<p>
Microsoft is not making overtures to the open source world out of love.
They are doing it for the money.  As is the case with any corporate,
their sole fudiciary duty is to their shareholders.  Please don't

&gt;&gt; &gt; As it so happens, there is a spate of attention around recent moves from
&gt;&gt; &gt; some of the Debian guys to include Mono in the Gnome distribution for
&gt;&gt; &gt; the latest Debian release.  The whole argument seems to be around the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Tomboy applet, which is a simple notebook like GNote.  For the privilege
&gt;&gt; &gt; of the Mono based Tomboy, you get an added 50MB of dependencies
&gt;&gt; &gt; introduced.  The size is a relatively minor issue though...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 'Like GNote' -- other way around, in fact: GNote is a C++ rewrite of
&gt;&gt; Tomboy. Tomboy is included by default, because it is part of GNOME 2.6
&gt;&gt; - GNote isn't.
&gt;
&gt; I stand corrected.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The argument for Mono seems to be: "It's open source, so it's ok".
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; What some people are missing with Mono, is that it is an implementation
&gt;&gt; &gt; of Microsoft's intellectual property, protected by numerous patents for
&gt;&gt; &gt; aspects of the .NET API, as well as patents against the C# language.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework#Standardization_and_licensing'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework#Standardization_and_licensing</a>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; "While Microsoft and their partners hold patents for the CLI and C#,
&gt;&gt; ECMA and ISO require that all patents essential to implementation be
&gt;&gt; made available under "reasonable and non-discriminatory terms". In
&gt;&gt; addition to meeting these terms, the companies have agreed to make the
&gt;&gt; patents available royalty-free."
&gt;
&gt; "reasonable and non-discriminatory terms":  Everyone is charged exactly
&gt; the same reasonable royalty in a non-discriminatory way.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Uhuh. But read the 'In addition' part.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; Tomboy uses GNOME-specific APIs on top of the ECMA part: there are no
&gt;&gt; realistic patent fears here.
&gt;
&gt; Permit me to respectfully disagree.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; FWIW, the Free Software Foundation have their own implementation of
&gt;&gt; the ECMA part of .Net called Portable.Net.
&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Perhaps your respectful disagreement, then, would be better redirected
to the FSF.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps it would be pertinent to point out the recent action Microsoft
&gt;&gt; &gt; instated against TomTom GPS systems;  TomTom used Linux as the base OS,
&gt;&gt; &gt; but used the VFAT file system to access flash storage.  TomTom came to
&gt;&gt; &gt; an out of court settlement with Microsoft, and although the details of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the agreement are unavailable, one might speculate that this entails
&gt;&gt; &gt; either replacing Linux, or paying the royalty.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's still just speculation, though.
&gt;
&gt; Yes it is speculation.  Can you think of any other agreement they might
&gt; have reached?
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Other than mere speculation?
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; The TomTom case strikes me as a particularly ridiculous example to be
&gt;&gt; used to advocate the removal of Mono for (potentially) infringing
&gt;&gt; Microsoft patents: wouldn't that also advocate the removal of Linux
&gt;&gt; itself?
&gt;
&gt; The TomTom case is an example of Microsoft enforcing their intellectual
&gt; property rights.  Please understand that although many people infringe
&gt; on the FAT patent every day, Microsoft normally has no interest in
&gt; actually enforcing it.  Instead, it is in their best interest that FAT
&gt; usage becomes as ubiquitous as possible, and the de facto standard.
&gt; This leads to situations such as that where TomTom have no choice other
&gt; than to use FAT.
&gt;
&gt; Far from being a "ridiculous example", the TomTom case has an
&gt; extrordinary bearing on Mono, and the adoption of C#.  FAT was
&gt; considered to be "free" for a great many years (around 15 years) until
&gt; MS patented it.  It is still considered by many to be free, but it is
&gt; not.  Just as with FAT, it is clearly in Microsoft's best interests for
&gt; DotNet &amp; C# to become as entrenched as can be.  Although Microsoft have
&gt; indicated that they will not "for now" be enforcing their C# and DotNet
&gt; patents, they have not relinquished their right to do so in future.
&gt;
&gt; Implicit in your last question, is that Linux itself is so riddled with
&gt; instances of patent breach, that this should "advocate the removal of
&gt; Linux itself".  According to IP law, users of Linux would be liable for
&gt; royalty to Microsoft for the extent to which they use features made
&gt; available by Linux, which are covered by Microsoft patents.  This is
&gt; evidenced in the TomTom case.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Maybe you need to reread what I wrote, or I need to rephrase what I
wrote, but your answer is almost completely disconnected from it.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; This "Devil be damned" attitude towards the intellectual property rights
&gt; (patents, trademarks,logos,copyright) of others is a very dangerous path
&gt; for the open source world to travel.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Quite true. The 'do nothing, for fear of litigation' attitude would be worse.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; I certainly wouldn't encourage anyone to trust Microsoft blindly, but
&gt;&gt; given their track record, I happen to think it's a good thing that
&gt;&gt; they're taking tentative steps into the worlds of open standards and
&gt;&gt; open source.
&gt;
&gt; Microsoft is not making overtures to the open source world out of love.

While this is not the point of this discussion, what I see about
Microsoft's (small) steps torward the open-source world are very
limited "open-ness" that gets you tied to then one way or another
(like the ms's OOXML, or the so called "open-source parts of ms
office") - "heres your free beer, but the licence says you must drink
it on licenced cups only" comes to my mind.

Might just be me, but I find it pretty weird when I notice wolves

&gt; Ben,
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, but I have no idea what "We'd all really apreciate it if you didn't
&gt; top post, either." means.  So, if I've done it again please explain.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
'Top posting' refers to the practice of including the original message
to which you are replying verbatim, with your reply at the top. The
preferred style when replying to a message on a public list is to
reply inline, as I am doing, so that it is instantly clear to what you
are replying. It is also good practice to delete parts of the original
mail to which you are not replying.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And, who in their right mind would use "-&gt;" for anything other than
&gt; something to do with "minus" or "greater than"!!!!!  Whomever did that in
&gt; PHP development was just not thinking.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
'-&gt;' is quite a standard idiom among programming languages: it's used
in C, C++, and Perl, among others, for more or less the same purpose.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Of course, I've been writing PHP code for well over a decade so there was no
&gt; attempt at object-orientation back then.  I was previously a VB 6 programmer
&gt; and before that I coded in ASM, BAL, Fortran, Algol, COBOL, APL, PL/I, C,
&gt; C++ and several other languages.
</pre>

<p>
If you've used C and C++, why do you question PHP's use of '-&gt;'?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; There is not a server-based
&gt; application development project where PHP can not be used.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
If the server is a web server, perhaps.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; 2) I want to go to Google and enter something like "vb.net code to upload a
&gt; file to Linux server" (without quotes).  I want working code to be displayed
&gt; that I can copy and use.  I want to have a solution implemented within five
&gt; minutes (300 seconds) and no more.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
I assume from your repeated mentions of PHP that you want this file
transfer to take place via HTTP - or even 'to a web server'. As it is,
asking about 'a linux server' makes it seem as though you are looking
for something /specific/ to Linux, which doesn't seem to be the case
at all.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; As I said, I already have a solution.  While I thank you for your "SSH"
&gt; suggestion (I usually use PuTTY), and while I might develop a solution that
&gt; uses SSH - your suggestion misses the point.  Using "SSH" in a google search
&gt; "code for programmatic use of SSH to upload a file to Linux server" does not
&gt; come close to presenting me with code I can use.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Again; the question/query is overly specific.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Seriously, the key point is this - I find it incredible that after entering
&gt; numerous Google, Bing, and Yahoo queries similar to "vb.net code to upload a
&gt; file to Linux server" and not a single one has produced a result where I can
&gt; copy and paste working vb.net code or even old vb code.  When code was
&gt; displayed it was usually in the form of a question i.e. "why doesn't this
&gt; code work?".
</pre>

<p>
Also; I'll freely admit that I'm not quite familiar with .Net etc.,
but my understanding is that the whole point of it is to have a common
API for use among multiple programming languages. I also seem to
recall that SharpDevelop, an open source .Net IDE for Windows, has a
facility to convert C Sharp code to VB.Net (specifically because there
are so few VB.Net examples around); perhaps if, in future, you search
for .Net solutions generally, rather than VB.Net specifically, you'll
have a better time finding what you're looking for.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; PLEASE, ANYONE ON THIS LIST, DO NOT SEND ME A SOLUTION.  I already have a working solution.
</pre>

<p>
Well, good for you. However, we answer questions for the benefit of
the readers of Linux Gazette, so...
</p>

<p>
Searching for 'vb.net upload via http' gets me this page, from Microsoft:
<a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.uploadfile(VS.71).aspx'>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.uploadfile(VS.71).aspx</a>
</p>

<p>
Filtering it down, the relevant lines are:
</p>

<pre>
Dim myWebClient As New WebClient()
Dim responseArray As Byte() = myWebClient.UploadFile(uriString,
"POST", fileName)

No joke.  I had never heard of it.  The only printed publication I read  
anymore is "Network World".   And, when "Network World" finally drops their 
print addition, my home will totally be devoid of all newspapers and  
magazines.
</p>

<p>
Also, your domain name is "linuxmafia.com" and you or someone else told me  
to add the "lists.linuxgazette.net" reference.  I had no intention of  
writing to a group.  I had originally written to someone as a result of a  
google search result.  Someone wrote to, in essense, inform me that they  
were responding instead of the other person.
</p>

<p>
Then, I was being criticized for making my original suggestion.
</p>

<p>
I was just looking for a solution so I did not have to develop my own  
solution.  I had to cobble together my own solution.  It certainly was not  
the simple solution I wanted - but it gets the job done.
</p>

<p>
Thanks.  I hope we are done with this conversation.  It is taking up too  
much of my time and your organization, publication, gang or whatever you  
want to call it has already informed me that, in essense, they do not care  
to develop/document solutions for "Linux-server/Windows-client" automated  
custom file upload solutions.  I certainly have no interest in documenting  
my solution because it is not elegant.  It just gets the job done for me.

&gt;&gt; Ben,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I love PHP.  Unfortunately not all people do.
&gt;
&gt;I teach the stuff - just came back from a week of teaching an advanced
&gt;course at a major insurance company - and I don't love it at all. PHP
&gt;is, in my opinion, unforgivably buggy, has <strong>way</strong> too many functions and
&gt;way too little flexibility, makes it too easy to write bad code, and has
&gt;too few testing/validation tools. It's relatively easy to learn/use
&gt;initially, but it quickly runs out of power; it uses a horribly-broken
&gt;imitation of OO which is missing much of the point of OO methodology,
&gt;and it is responsible for more than a third of <strong>all</strong> vulnerabilities in
&gt;the National Vulnerability Database last year (it was almost <em>half</em> of
&gt;all vulns back in 2006.) 
</pre>

<p>
To me this reads as one big "the coders suck" argument under cover as
"the language sucks". The majority of those National Vulnerability
Database issues are caused by sloppy coding, but that's the same with
any language (Wikipedia notes 1% of those vulnerabilities were in the
language itself) - I think back to my first C program and cringe at my
memory "management".
</p>

<p>
Your points, security related included, could be said about any
language. That's the nature of programming: it gives the programmer
power. And with great power ... well, you get my point. The reason PHP
and several other languages get so much of the type of flack you flung
is that they're newbie friendly. You have web designers who barely
understand HTML copying and pasting PHP and making slight modifications
to poll you on your favorite ice cream flavor. This is okay in theory,
but can be scary - then again, a lot of what so called professional
programmers create to charge your credit card for electronic payment or
route packets is even scarier. The same thing happens with other
languages.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;The only way to make it even marginally better
&gt;requires using a closed-source app with a truly weird licensing scheme
&gt;(Zend), and even that solution is less than wonderful.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Never had to touch the stuff, "enterprise class" platforms included. 
</p>

<p>

</p>


<pre>
&gt;But that could just be the result of intense contact with it over the
&gt;past week. A month down the road, I'll probably have a somewhat milder
&gt;opinion of it. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
I have strategically timed this e-mail to come in just short of the one
month mark. ;-)
</p>

<p>
p.s. Sorry for being in such lurk mode recently on the list, but I
recently left my big-to-do corporate job to return to owning a business.

That would be true, except for... well, everything. It is probably
accurate to say that there are more sucky PHP coders, percentage-wise,
than there are for most other languages; this does not mean that PHP
itself does not suck. In fact, it strongly implies the opposite. As to
the number of vulnerabilities, 1% of PHP is quite a large chunk - and
this has nothing to do with PHP coders; these functions are part of the
language, which is not itself written in PHP. I seem to recall that a
recent version of PHP had something like 4000+ <strong>core</strong> functions - and
tens of thousands of non-core ones. By contrast, Perl has somewhere in
the low 200s range for the core funcs. 1% of PHP - i.e., 40 or more
functions that are broken - is a very large and ugly number.
</p>

<p>
In addition to that, I suggest you try googling for 'month of PHP bugs'
sometime. This was a month-long attempt to crack at least a function a
day by a frustrated developer; it succeeded, with a ridiculously high
number of functions.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Your points, security related included, could be said about any language.
</pre>

<p>
The point you're missing, Sam, is that of degree. No, there are no
100%-foolproof languages; fools are too ingenuous. Some, however,
practically <strong>drag</strong> the fools into paths where angels fear to tread - and
PHP, if not #1 in that lineup, is certainly in the running for that top
spot.
</p>

<p>
As a counter-example, take a look at Perl - a language that a lot of
people consider to be difficult to write well (and yes, there's quite a
number of bad Perl coders out there.) The language itself, however,
provides a large variety of tools for testing your code *automatically*:
</p>

<pre>
-w/-W				Enable many/all warnings
'use warnings;'  	Similar to '-w'
'use strict;'		Fail on a large number doubtful constructs
-T					Require pre-processing of all user data
</pre>

<p>
In fact, Perl will give you as much critique/criticism as you can stand:
</p>

<p>
<a href='http://perlcritic.com/'>http://perlcritic.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
Or you can install Perl::Critic as a module, and have your own machine
harsh on you any time you think you're perfect. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
By contrast, PHP has... nothing. Someone tried, some years ago, to have
a sorta-'lint' for PHP4 (Pixy - written in Java, as I recall) - and that
was about it. 
</p>

<p>
In short, the language itself is broken, and neither the developers nor
the users care. If you <em>do</em> decide to care, there's little or nothing
you can do about it.

I disagree, completely. Other languages don't force dangerous weapons
into the hands of little children. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Sam, feel free to send me a couple of hundred lines of your favorite PHP
code. If I can't find a number of bugs in it, I'll a) be very surprised,
and b) admit that you are a superlative PHP coder. If you lose, though,
you'll have to write a detailed explanation of why and how PHP sucks. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Something that makes it worse for PHP is the fact that it is a
web-developing language - makes it have way more users than "desktop"
languages, what makes user-related problems way more aparent than
anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
Try googling for asp vulnerabilities (ok, that was a joke) or ror
vulnerabilities - it is more fair for the comparison.
