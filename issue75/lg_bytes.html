<FONT COLOR="green">Jon Johansen Indicted by Norwegian Authorities
Regarding DeCSS
</FONT>
</H3> 

Unhappy news this month, as it emerged that Jon Johansen has been 
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/news/306">
indicted</a>
by Norwegian authorities for his part in creating and distributing the
DeCSS code.  This comes two years after he and his father were 
<a href="http://www.2600.com/news/display.shtml?id=343">
first</a> taken from their home in connection with the same software.
The initial report is available
<a href="http://www.nettavisen.no/servlets/page?section=9&item=194062">
in Norwegian</a>, and a 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=25975&cid=2816391">
translation</a> was posted in the Slashdot
<a href="http://slashdot.org/yro/02/01/10/1433237.shtml">
discussion</a> of the story. 
<p>
It appears that the case against Jon is unusual in that he is being charged
under laws which are generally applied in cases involving breaking into
computers and theft of electronic records or company files.  Pressure from
the MPAA and the US entertainment industry appears to have encouraged the
Norwegian authorities to try this experimental attempt to secure a
conviction.
<p>
The 
<a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
have extensive resources on 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DeCSS_prosecutions/Johansen_DeCSS_case/">
this case</a>.
Particularly interesting are
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/DVDCCA_case/20000118_bing_norway_law_decl.html">
some legal arguments</a>
as to why no offence has been committed
under Norwegian law
and
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/MPAA_DVD_cases/20000720_ny_trial_transcript.html">
transcripts</a>
including Jon Johansen's testimony at the 2600 Magazine trial in New
York under the DMCA (July 20, 2000).
<p>
A
<a href="https://www.eff.org/mailman/listinfo/free-jon">
mailing list</a>
has also been set up to discuss issues concerning the case, including how
to support Jon and how to protest against the indictment.

<p>
The sorry truth is that cases like this are likely to become more common in
the future.  Governments internationally are harmonising their intellectual
property laws through measures such as
<a href="http://www.ifpi.org/site-content/press/20011206.html">
the WIPO copyright treaty</a>
which will come into force in March (having recently secured its 30th
signatory).  The result will be that all countries might eventually enact
legislation akin to the DMCA to protect the media multinationals'
intellectual property and access-control technologies.  Countries
attempting to resist this trend will not be well received.  Slashdot 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/01/03/1621205.shtml">
reported recently</a>
that Ukraine is subject to US trade sanctions for not using an "optical
media licensing regime" for blank CDs and CD recorders.  The best
way to resist at an individual level is to make your voice heard and start
lobbying and writing letters.  Your local LUG could form a focus for this
activity.

<a href="http://www.house.gov/boucher/">
Congressman Rick Boucher</a>
has been receiving a lot of press lately for the
position he has taken with regard to issues such as digital rights
management and the DMCA.
<a href="http://www.dotcomscoop.com/">
Dotcom Scoop</a>
recently
<a href="http://www.dotcomscoop.com/article.php?sid=81">
reported</a>
that Congressman Boucher has 
<a href="http://www.dotcomscoop.com/article.php?sid=80">
written</a>
to the RIAA expressing his
concern at the introduction of copy-protected compact discs.  He feels that
such developments "...may prevent or inhibit consumer home recording using
recorders and media covered by the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992". A
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/23587.html">
report</a>
on the same story in The Register, however, indicated that the copy
protection measures probably are legal.  It seems that though the record
label cannot sue you for making a legitimate personal copy of your new CD,
they are not obliged to make it easy for you!
ZDNet has
<a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1106-802646.html?legacy=zdnn&chkpt=zdnnp1tp02">
reported</a> [<a href="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</a>]
that Boucher is planning to introduce a bill that would eliminate the
"anti-circumvention" clause of the DMCA.  It is certainly encouraging to
see an elected representative taking an overtly pro-consumer line on these
issues.
<p>
Another elected representative who seems to understand a thing or two is
Rep. Darrell Issa, a member of the US House of Representatives' Judiciary
Committee.  
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5714">
Speaking</a>
to <EM>Linux Journal's</EM> Don Marti, he indicated that the SSSCA was "dead on arrival".
Though this is encouraging,  it might be foolish to get too relaxed until
the grave is actually occupied.  Don comments that Issa also seemed
well informed on other issues in this area (DMCA, etc.,).
<p>
Perhaps when campaigning on issues of concern, it would be wise to be alert
to good as well as bad news.  Elected representatives careers are
based on achieving public support and they can be very sensitive to public
opinion.  It could not hurt to mail guys like Boucher and Issa to tell
them if you like what they are doing.

</H3> 

<P>
LWN reported that
<a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0103/">
UCITA is back again</a>.
The main issue for the free software community would be that the UCITA, if
it came into US law in its current form, would prohibit the distribution of
software to consumers without warranty.  This would mean that by
distributing a free software utility, you could be held responsible by
consumers for any flaws in the product (even though you have disclaimed all
warranties, etc.,).  This story was also
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23675.html">reported</a>
by TheRegister, who linked to

It appears issues of control loom large in this area, with media companies
loath to take any move which might loosen their grip on the "content
industry".  Embracing broadband would be just such a move.

<FONT COLOR="green">Euro Support
</FONT>
</H3> 

As many of you have surely noticed, the euro became a real paper and coins
currency on the first of January 2002.  Being able to type the euro symbol
is now something which will be necessary for very many computer users.
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">
The Debian Project</a> 
have released the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-euro-support/">
Debian Euro HOWTO</a>
by Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña which details how to enable support for
the symbol in your Linux system.  Much of the advice will be of use to
users of distributions other than Debian.
<p>
Long-term, the best solution may be a move towards Unicode. This is
particularly the case when interoperability with Windows systems is
required.

<FONT COLOR="green">Athlon/Duron and Linux Bug
</FONT>
</H3> 
A bug in AMD's Athlon family of processors has been
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/3/23749.html">
reported</a>
on TheRegister, following an earlier
revelation by
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a>.  The issue relates to
extended memory paging sizes and is a bug in the processor, not the kernel.
Those using Linux 2.4 kernels, and AGP may experience problems with memory
corruption.  The fix is to pass the option "mem=nopentium" to the kernel at
boot-time (via GRUB or LILO).  Gentoo have a good description of the
situation on their main webpage at the moment, and an analysis of how this
was neglected for so long (since September 2000!).

recently
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23667.html">

that Korea is to convert 120K civil servants to Linux desktop use.  This
appears to be as much a fightback by local favourite Haansoft (producers of
Hancom Linux, and HancomOffice) as a victory for Linux, but it is still
good news.
<p>
In a separate development, NewsForge
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/01/09/1252220&mode=nocomment">
reports</a> that
Red Hat India is helping to introduce GNU/Linux as part of a scheme to meet
the software needs of the Indian education system. The program will include
not only software, but also free training to help get the scheme off the
ground.

report</a>
that Linux is making an impression on many in China.  Apparently the
Chinese Academy of Sciences have published a report highlighting the
savings which could be achieved by using Linux as an alternative to
Microsoft solutions.  This follows a Gartner
<a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=103604">
report</a> that Microsoft recently lost out on a major IT investment in
China, while indigenous firms including Red Flag Linux were favoured.

<a href="http://www.qualys.com">
qualys.com</a>
have 
<a href="https://www.qualys.com/pr/release_01_09_02.html">
announced</a>
that they have discovered a Linux Trojan, in the wild.
This follows qualys's discovery of a very similar linux trojan 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/09/08/019246">
last year</a>.  This story was also
<a href="http://www.newsbytes.com/news/02/173408.html">
picked up</a> by Newsbytes.com, and from there Slashdot 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/01/05/230233&mode=nested">
got in on the act</a>.  To be infected, you must execute the trojan
as root, so there is likely to be a need for some sort of social
engineering in getting this one to propagate.  Main risk would be if a
binary in a Linux distribution became infected, since most people trust the
binaries on their install media.  At the very least, this is another very
good reason to be very very careful what you do as root.

BrlSpeak is a new mini-distribution of Linux that comes with support for
<STRONG>braille</STRONG> and <STRONG>speech</STRONG> built-in.  The objective
is to offer an easy-to-install solution for blind persons who wish to install a
Linux distribution on their computer without any assistance from a sighted
pereson.  BrlSpeak provides a built-in preconfigurer so that you should be able
to preconfigure the BrlTty Makefile before starting Linux.  Compilation and
automated activation of the braille device is the next step, and will be
performed when booting the distrib.  BrlSpeak was based on Matthew campbell's
ZipSpeak mini-distribution, that's why it contains the SpeakUp screen reader
for supporting speech synthesizers.  The BrlSpeak is available in many
languages.  To download it, visit the

Debian Weekly News

reported</a> that
new "Debian on CD" Web Pages have been 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/CD/">

These replace the
old pages on 
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/">
cdimage.debian.org</a>,
which "were often criticised by visitors of the website". The new pages
feature improved documentation, direct download links for images, a CD

links for CD images, a list of CD vendors, artwork, and info on
<a href="http://atterer.net/jigdo/">

more than 55,000,000 physical SLOC:
The COCOMO model estimates
that its cost would be close to $1.9 billion USD to develop

was this
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=129604">
bugreport</a>, which comments on vulnerability notification and the Debian
Social Contract.
"Over the past few months,
the GNU/Linux community has slowly adopted a way of dealing with
security issues which closely resembles the approach suggested by
Microsoft last year: more-or-less systematic hiding of security
problems from end users, at least for some time. Some Debian
maintainers seem to participate in this process, and hold
back security fixes, waiting for events to happen which are
external and not related to the Debian project (for example,
other distributors being ready to publish fixes)."

The Washington Post Washtech.com site has
<a href="http://www.washtech.com/news/media/14759-1.html">
reported</a>
that AOL Time Warner is in talks to buy Red Hat.  Everything is very vague
("fluid" appears to be the official term), so it is difficult to know what
the chances are such a deal actually coming off.  Andrew Orlowski of
TheRegister is somewhat
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/7/23746.html">
sceptical</a>
about the rumours.  He also makes some good comments about what the
wider implications of such a deal could be.
