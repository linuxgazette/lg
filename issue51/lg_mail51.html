<BR>Subject: Modem problem with 5.2

<P> I have recently setup Linux 5.2 on a PC at home. The setup went great with
only one problem:
I cannot get the modem to dial so that I can access the Internet. Looking
through various websites on 
Linux, I found that if your modem is on com3 there is some additional setup
that is required. Can you
help me with this? I have mapped the com3 port to /dev/cua2 and by the
manual that is all I thought
I had to do. I also ran statserial on this port and I get the correct
information here also. What
could be wrong? I can hear the modem clicking like it is trying to dial,
but it will never dial the
number. Thanks.

<BR>Subject: IP Masquerade Connection Problems


<P> I've been running Linux for a few years now, using mostly RedHat
distributions.  I'm currently running RedHat 6.1.  Recently, I decided to
connect my small office (4 workstation nodes and 2 servers) to the internet
via IP Masquerading rather than having each workstation dial directly (as
was done previously).

<P> IP Masquerading works fine, save for one small problem that's turning into a
real annoyance.  I'm using PAP authentication with the ISP.  Whenever I
initiate a connection, the modem dials, waits until whatever timeout is
specified, then hangs up without ever achieving a complete connection.  The
two modems handshake, but the login to the ISP is never successfully
completed.  Since I've specified for it to reconnect on a line drop, it
immediately redials and then successfully connects and logs in on the second
try.

<P> This is 99.9% consistent, meaning that it nearly always requires two dial
attempts to get a successful connection.  On rare occaisons, it will connect
on the first try, but this is apparently only after I've just downed the
interface within the past few minutes.  I don't have it configured for
demand dial at this point -- I normally bring the link up and down manually
via ifup ppp0 and ifdown ppp0.  Eventually this will be set to demand dial
once I'm confident of the configuration.

<P> I suspected the ISP at first, but then I tried a Mandrake 6.5 distribution
on the same equipment (with essentially the same config files), and it
connects the first time every time.  I'd much rather use RedHat 6.1,
however, for various reasons.  I've even tried a few different modems, both
56K and K56Flex, and the results are the same.

<P> Does anyone have any ideas as to why this would be happening and how to
correct it?

<P> TIA.

[When people have gotten weird permissions like
that, it's often the sign of serious disk corruption.  I would definitely
back up any data you can right now just in case the drive fails in the near
future.  Is the drive otherwise working OK?  I would be inclined
to buy a new drive and install a fresh copy of Linux on it, and then later
decide whether to trust this drive enough to continue using it.  Hard drives
and power supplies are the most failure-prone components of any PC.  
Fortunately, nowadays hard drives are cheap to replace.

<P> I've been trying to use linuxconf (ver 1.14 on a RH 6.0 install) and
have now screwed  it up in my computers at work and at home in the same
way. When I'm ready to leave linuxconf it wants to "sync" the
configuration with the system. Every time I run linuxconf now it says
that it must execute "/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S85gpm start".  And then, even
after it does so, it still says it's not in sync and it wants to do it
again. I guess that it thinks it must start the mouse even though it's
already running.

<P> How do I fix this?

<P> A possibly significant piece of information is that in both cases when
I originally installed Red Hat I chose the wrong mouse driver and had to
play around to find the right one.

<P> Hi

<P> This little problem has been sending me nuts for two days now.
I sure hope someone in the <I>LG</I> community can help


<P> I wonder if someone would mind helping me with a mystery that is causing me
to pull my hair out......

<P> I have been using a Linux server based on RedHat 5.2 for some time to
connect to the Internet and provide masquerade for a bunch of Windows boxes
on a private network behind it.


<P> Today I decided to redo the server to incorporate a few more sophisticated
things like DNS, DHCP and HTTP serving for a prototype intranet.

<P> All went very well with one small hiccup. There seems to be an undocumented
change in the behavior of ppp between RedHat 6.1 and 5.2.

<P> Using 5.2 invoking "ifup ppp1" will result in the server making one and one
only attempt to connect to the internet.

<P> This is exactly what I want

<P> Using 6.1 if the dialout attempt fails, it simply loops and tries again and
again until it either connects or is stopped.

<P> I don't want this.

<P> I have compared all the relevant (I hope) scripts between 5.2 and 6.1 but I
cannot find a difference that would account for the changed behavior.

<P> I have the awful feeling I've missed something important (it's been a long
day), could someone please tell me what it is?

[There's an lg-announce mailing list.  See the Linux Gazette FAQ at
<A HREF="../faq/index.html">http://www.linuxgazette.net/faq/index.html</A>
http://www.linuxgazette.net/faq/index.html

<P> KDE and GNOME are graphical "environments" (that is, a set of custom
applications, widgets and rules that all have a common "look and feel").
A window manager is just one aspect of this.  In my opinion, KDE is
currently "ahead".  But I don't tell people, "Use KDE, it's #1."  I use
KDE at work, but only because it's the default, and I don't use 90% of
its features.  At home I use fvwm2.  

<P> Some people want to see Linux have a single standard desktop.  However,
I think most people are glad there's a choice, because different people
want different things.  Indeed, with some people running Linux for
games (i.e., they need a 3D video card and fast drivers) and other people
running it on 486s as servers, different people have very different software
needs.  KDE and GNOME tend to appeal to people who want a standard look and
feel a la Windows and the Mac.  But those who hack with the older programming
tools are never going to give them up.  As the geek joke goes, "Who needs a GUI
when you've got Emacs?" 

<P> February's <I>Linux Journal</I> had an in-depth look at KDE and
at GNOME.  Both articles are on-line at

<BR>Subject: Memory undetected

<P> Hello there.

<P> I've got some problems with my RAM: Linux only detecs 64 M when I have 128.
My specs are: SuSE Linux 6.3, kernel 2.2.13, runnin in a AMD k6-2 350 box. The
weirdest thing is that the whole 128 M are in the same DIMM slot. The bios
seems to detect 128 M, and also that other op. system which in don't want to
name.  Could anyone help me here?

<P> Thanks



<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
[Linux cannot auto-detect memory above 64MB.  You have to tell it
explicitly how much memory you have at the boot prompt, or put
<PRE>
append = "mem8M"
</PRE>
in your /etc/lilo.conf file and re-run lilo (if you're using lilo; see
the lilo documentation).  

<P> The problem is that the BIOS detects the extra memory but it doesn't tell
Linux about it.  It's a limitation in the PC BIOS design.  I don't know how
that other OS probes for memory.

<P> If you ever reduce the amount of memory you have, remember to tell lilo
first.  Otherwise, the system will segfault at boot time when it tries to use
memory that isn't there.  You can always type "mem=64M" at the boot prompt to
override what lilo thinks.

<BR>Subject: glibc compilation problem

<P> Hello everyone,

<P> I'm making glibc 2.1.2 from the source tarball for use in building a
system from the
ground up (to get rid of all those statically linked programs I've
started with).  Well,
when compiling either 2.1.2 or 2.1.1, I get following error and the
compilation stops:


<PRE>
common/db_appinit.c: In function `__db_appname':
common/db_appinit.c:479: fixed or forbidden register 0 (ax) was spilled

<P> I have pgcc 2.95.2, which I believe fills the requirement for gcc.  I'm
clueless as to
what else can be causing this.  Any ideas?

<P> btw, I come up with some other undefined function error when trying to
compile glibc
2.0.7pre6, and I don't want to use the older glibc, anyway.

<P> Someone has to know what causes these kinds of errors, right? :)

<BR>Subject: bash problem

<P> I have an interesting problem with my bash prompt.  The upper case K and
T letters do not echo to the screen, and when I type them it beeps at
me.  Now, before jumping to conclusions, let me describe what I've done
so far.  This problem only occurs in bash and bash2, not in tcsh, zsh,
csh, etc.  I've recompiled and reinstalled bash several times from both
the source tarballs and source rpms.  I've replaced very thing terminal
related that I can think of, such as gettydefs and libtermcap.  I've
looked at my keymaps repeatedly, and there doesn't seem to be a problem
there--and again, it only happens in bash.  It has to be something
broken which I haven't replaced yet, but I'm not sure what is left.  The
K and T letters work fine in programs spawned in bash, it's just the
prompt itself.  This one has just about everyone I know confused.
Hopefully someone out there can help or has heard of this odd problem.
If anyone would like more details or has any information, please contact
me.

<P> Thanks,

<BR>Subject: unable to install

<P> Hi

<P> I don't know if this is the proper way to contact you, but this is the
address I found searching through Internet for solution for my problem:

<P> PC is PII233 (LX) with 128 MB DIMM SDRAM, 6.4 GB WD HDD, Diamond Speedstar
50 AGP (4MB) VGA, Genius LAN card, Philips 40x CD, ps/2 keyboard and mouse.
On it I have installed NT Workstation 4.0 on first partition (4G) formatted
as NTFS. NT is working fine.

<P> Now, I wanted to put Linux RedHat 6.1 on second partition. First I checked
HCL for my PC - OK. On Internet I found documents how to boot Linux using NT
Loader and everything seemed to be fine until i started actual installation
booting it from CD. It loaded X graphical display, gave me choice for
language and keyboard, and then disk druid started. I could see my NTFS
partition as HPFS but I knew this would happen since I red about it before.
So out of unused ~2 GB I created swap (129M) and root (2G) partition and
after i pressed next, error was displayed "error opening security file ..."
and termination and kill signals stopped further installation.

<P> Now, I know that this is not a fatal error (security..), but what is the
problem then? I tryed to change partitioning (added /boot partition, many
combinations) but nothing seem to work. There is no explanation WHY this
happens, on wich module installation fails. Then I got new boot diskette
from RedHat, tryed with it, but same thing happened. So I put some boot
parameters like MEM8M and changed keyboard type, but still nothing.

<P> Maybe installation log would help, but it is going fast on my screen and I
can't read it, is there a way to save it to diskette since I can't put it on
NTFS partition? Is this partition a problem somehow? Shouldn't be.

<P> Please answer as soon as you can because it is really urgent for me to get
this Linux going.

<P> Thank you in advance

<P> Ivica Glavocic

<BR>Subject: Pundit Here, Pundit There, Pundits Everywhere

<H4>Pundit Here, Pundit There, Pundits Everywhere</H4>

<P> Pundits.  Had enough of that word yet? I know I have and I also know there
are a few of these so-called experts whose teeth I would like knock out (I
guess the web equivalent would be breaking their knuckles or something). In all
honesty, since when did becoming an expert one area of technology suddenly make
one an absolute know-it-all about all technology? This has suddenly become the
new thing to be: an industry pundit, a technology pundit, or whatever. A
pundit, by the definition I refer to, is an accomplished expert in a particular
discipline. This e-world of ours has suddenly given anyone who has the time and
tenacity to become a pundit the opportunity to do so. Those whom have been in
the industry a long time have received that label, and rightfully so, for
excelling in a particular field. All of a sudden, however, many of these
pundits are breaking away from their disciplines and yammering about others. I
would rather they did not.</p>

<P> <H4>The Neo Pundit Know It All</H4>

<P> This is the group that really irritates me. They started out as people who
knew a lot about something, and in some cases, they outright contributed to
making something, setting a trend or engineering a brilliant new process. While
these people should be (and have been) commended, after a period of time they
suddenly become experts in other fields as well, but now they can forego
validation. Why that is, I have no idea. One can relate it to actors/actresses
or music stars who suddenly feel they should become involved with politics and
that their ideas are right. While there is a difference of sorts, you can see
the obvious parallel: I'm a somebody now so everything I say should be taken
seriously.</p>

<P> <H4>Losing Readers</H4>

<P> This sort of abuse of journalistic power needs to stop, someone needs to
start putting an end to it. The reason it needs to stop is not just ethics, it
really has more to do (in my opinion) with quality. If a person is particularly
known for having insightful columns on a given subject, chances are, I will
read them. The second they step into unknown territory and blunder, they lose
credibility in my eyes. While I may be just one person, I highly doubt I am the
only one who stops reading the material they write about because they
blundered.</p>

<P> <H4>Misinforming Glassy Eyed Suits</H4>

<P> Another point many administrators have brought to my attention has been the
pointy-haired-boss syndrome. A Glassy-Eyed Suit (IS Department Head) reads a
well-known, well-respected pundits column. It must true, right? Those who
know no better cannot be protected by the sane. A pundit writing about
something outside the sphere of their knowledge is in fact damaging the
industry as a whole. Knuckleheads across the world will do a 180 based upon
what some guy at some zine printed. Surely this is a good enough reason not to
arbitrarily write about something.</p>

<P> <H4>I Did it for the Hits . . . Come on the Hits . . .</H4>

<P> Word has it, if you secretly embed the word Linux on Coke cans, Coke sales
will skyrocket. Zines across the globe are printing Linux this and Linux that,
all for the sake of advertising dollars. That, in itself, is disgraceful. It
is bad enough that there are so many 2-bit sites in general  The fact that
established journalists are using Linux to bring in the hits is repulsive.</p>

<P> <H4>Okay Wise Guy What About YOU?</H4>

<P> So am I being hypocritical? In a sense, yes, because I really do not know
much about Journalism, then again, I am not a pundit now am I? This trend has
been going on for a long time now. It is my hope, that by seeing this, not only
will you as a reader take the extra step to verify the information source, but
perhaps those readers out there who are writers will think twice about their
next article. </p>

[The thing about Linux on coke cans reminded me of something somebody said
