<P> KYZO has today released the commercial version of its hugely popular
PizzaBox Linux distribution, so called because a prototype server was
built in a Pizza Hut Takeout box - take a look - 
<A HREF=http://www.kyzo.com>www.kyzo.com</A>

<P> In the first month the site took over 500,000 hits has recently
registered 75,000 in one day. Registered users that have downloaded and
run the free PizzaBox Server include both the Goddard Space Flight
Centre and the Jet Propulsion Laboratories at NASA. 

<P> The commercial version is the same basic software as the free version,
which will still be available, but differs in one significant respect.
It is shipped pre-installed in a bootable Flash-ROM and comes with the
the circuit board you need to make it boot in any 486 (or above) PC.
With 10 times the life span of a hard disk, the package is aimed at
system builders who are fed up with having to send skilled engineers to
sites for days on end to re-install a File Server every time a hard
drive goes down. 

<P> The system includes File, Print &amp; CD sharing, remote access (for full
remote administration), UPS monitoring, Tape backup, Hardware
monitoring, APM. It will automatically accept both SCSI &amp; IDE hard
drives and comes with a sophisticated, JavaScript enabled, web
management interface. It is aimed squarely at the SME market where
current offerings from the big players are overcomplicated for the SME
sector.

<P> Lausanne, Switzerland, November 2, 1999 - Calerga announces today SysQuake
Viewer for Linux, a port to the Linux operating system of the software for
understanding systems by interactive manipulation of graphics.

<P> SysQuake is a ground-breaking application for understanding and designing
complex systems by the use of interactive graphics. Interactivity lets the
user manipulate graphics, observe how phenomena are related, and change
parameters to improve the design of a technical device. Understanding how
initial conditions affect a simulation or how the parameters of a feedback
controller determine the behavior of a dynamic system is made much 
easier
than with the static graphics created by existing software.

<P> TUSTIN, CA -- November 4, 1999 -- Loki Entertainment  announces today the 
creation of a CVS server to facilitate public access to its Open-Source 
projects.

<P> "One reason we've been successful is that we create Open Source tools to 
replace proprietary code in our games," said Scott Draeker, president of 
Loki. "We give these tools back to the community in the form of Open 
Source projects. We hope other developers will evaluate our tools for 
projects and choose to use them rather than the proprietary alternatives."

<P> The Loki CVS server allows the public to access the latest development 
source code for Loki's several Open-Source projects, including SMJPEG, a 
motion JPEG library, SMPEG, a MPEG-1 playback library, and Setup, a GUI 
Installer. Other modules available for viewing include SDL, a 
cross-platform multimedia development API, and Mixer, an enhanced version 
of the sample SDL audio mixer.

<P> Loki's Open-Source projects are freely available for download from <A
HREF=http://www.lokigames.com>www.lokigames.com</A>, and are offered under the
GNU Library Public License (LGPL). A web interface for the CVS server is
available at <A HREF=http://cvs.lokigames.com>cvs.lokigames.com</A>.
