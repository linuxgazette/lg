#I'm finally getting around to automating this, so bear with me -- there
#will be teething problems.

This month's Laundrette is somewhat generated (w00t!) using a silly
sed script. I don't think there are too many problems with this, and it has
certainly made compiling this easier.

One thing that every group of people I have had anything to do with has had
in common is a healthy collective sense of humour, and an appreciation for
the surreal. (I don't think I need to point out that the group of LG regulars
who have been mercilessly quoted here are no exception, but I guess I just
did).

I appreciate your reply -- and so fast.

[Ben]
[grin] It happens sometimes, around here. Other times, nobody will say
anything until someone makes a comment a week down the road, and then -
oh, brother, take cover! We've been known to wander from rhubarb to US
history, taking a detour into European supermarkets and Cockney rhyming
slang along the way... but we usually get the question answered. Some
way or another.
]]

Because the off-topic threads tend to spawn other off-topic
threads, I've changed the format a little. Hopefully this will work out
better, as trying to find a way to show the different reply levels has been
a headache.

This means that the 'wacko topics' aren't cleanly separated from the humourous
messages: though I probably could move them around, I think it gives a bit
more of an insight into how our (twisted) minds work. Whether or not that's
a good thing is best judged in hindsight.

It does mean that our in-jokes are a little more transparent to any
unsuspecting newcomer; we can just throw out a link, and all is explained.
That's pretty important to us, because here at LG, the party is open to all
comers (just bring your own beer). 

(That said, I'm tempted to throw in something baffling: monkeys, toasters,
squid, school uniforms, tractors. A few of my co-workers should be in tears
of laughter by now :)

!S!jokes|Spam Jokes!!

A group was touring London, marveling at the historic buildings, art 
collections, and such. The group included people from many countries. During 
the tour of the Tower of London, a man from Prague and another man from 
Athens struck up a conversation about some point in history.

A small disagreement ensued, which rapidly became a large one. They decided 
to settle the matter then and there using the historical accouterments at 
hand. Donning armor and chain mail, they prepared for a battle to the death. 
This attracted the attention of the rest of the tour group, who crowded 
around for a better look. Inasmuch as the combatants were in period dress, 
the people couldn't tell one from another.

"Is that the Czech wearing the armor?" asked one tourist. "No," replied another, 
"The Greek is in the armor. The Czech is in the mail."

causing me to swerve at the last second. I yelled out: "F&**king kids!"

The CIA had an opening for an assassin.

After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there 
were three finalists - two men and one woman. For the final test, the CIA 
agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun.

"We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the 
circumstances. Inside this room you will find your wife sitting in a chair. 
You have to kill her." The first man said. "You can't be serious. I could 
never shoot my wife." The agent replies, "Then you're not the right man for 
this job."

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into 
the room. All was quiet for about five minutes. Then the agent came out with 
tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent replies, 
"You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."

Finally, it was the woman's turn. Only she was told to kill her husband. She 
took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. 
They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, 
all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the 
sweat from her brow and said, "You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with 
blanks. So I had to beat him to death with the chair."

true that "other people do it". They're getting worse help and less
help. They just haven't yet figured it out.

Don't clean up your act to please me. Yes, I'd prefer that you avoid

Why, Brian! You missed the salient factor, the very fact that makes this

you noted above, the interest is *negative* - that is, they pay you for
taking out the loan.

subtract the number of polar bears in Zimbabawe, raise to the power of

forms, and then look to see if the DOB given is yesterday.

[Ben]
Best of all, you can borrow the money for the payments
from Corinne - the interest from that second loan will easily pay for
the first one, and leave you enough cash to start a loan company of your

!W!guns|Guns & Crime!!

[Sluggo]
I was talking with an NRA fan last night, and he said guns were banned
in the UK only a few years ago, crime has increased fourfold since then,
and London now has a worse crime rate than New York City.  Sounds far
fetched but could there be some truth in it?

[Pete Jewell]
#[Pete Jewell] :1:
Sounds like absolute rubbish to me.  There has been gun controls in place as 
long as I can remember - perhaps there wern't any at the beginning of the 20th 
century.  Not sure where your fan got their crime figures - were they talking 
about a particular type of crime, or overall?

If anything there has been a tightening of gun laws over the last two decades, 
especially after the tradegy in Hungerford. 

[[
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungerford_Massacre
]]

[Neil]
#[Neil] :1:
Someone is severely twisting the facts to fit an argument here. We've had gun 
controls for as long as I can remember and OK they were tightened beyond what 
I would consider reasonable in the wake of the Hungerford shootings, but 
we've never had anything like the American gun culture. 

A fourfold increase in crime in a few years? Hey, you'd think I might have 
noticed, living in Britain as I do. Certainly there's been an increase in gun 
crime over the last couple of decades, but that hasn't been affected in any 
way by the change in the law AFAICT. The apparent size of the increase in 
relative terms is probably down to starting from a very low base at least in 
comparison to the USA. In absolute terms, I believe we still have a very long 
way to go to catch up with the US in terms of murders/shootings per head of 
population (that statement made without checking any facts).

[Ben]
#[Ben] :1:
Interesting. I'd imagine the peak of this has passed, but does the above
take into account 30 years (or so) of IRA battles? I would think that
the figures for the UK would be quite high as compared to New York - or
any other part of the US.

Just to keep parity, I haven't checked any facts either.  :) 

[Neil]
#[Neil] :2:
30 years or so of IRA battles didn't really amount to a fraction of what you 
seem to think. ISTR that statistically more people are killed on the roads in 
a year than were killed in the whole of "the troubles". 

[Ben]
#[Ben] :2:
OK; I did say that I hadn't checked. However, comparing murder stats to
car accident stats is anything but complimentary to the former; there
are a HUGE number of car-related deaths. The fact that no one is going
to do anything about them doesn't make the number low.

[Neil]
#[Neil] :3:
OK. I was just trying to put the whole IRA thing into some kind of 
perspective. I have the possibly mistaken impression that most Americans 
believe that Britain during the troubles was a dangerous place and that 
London was far too dangerous to visit.

[Ben]
#[Ben] :3:
I'm not sure about "dangerous" on an absolute scale, WRT that
perception; more dangerous by some small measure, surely, but lots of
people continue to visit Israel - which is in the middle of a war. I
don't think London lost much in a way of tourism due to it; a quick look
at Net resources says that it grew pretty steadily, up to 5 mil last
year.

IMO, most Americans see London as a romantic and historically
fascinating place; I doubt that anyone who had the time, the interest,
and the money to travel there would seriously consider that sort of
"danger".

most people would not even consider visiting it.  However, I've never
heard of anybody putting off travel to Britian because of the few
isolated bombings there.

[Neil]
#[Neil] :3:
I grew up in London during that period and there were occasional bombs, I even 
missed a couple by an hour or two, but really it had little impact on the 
mainland, except for a few unlucky people who were in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. The effects in Northern Ireland were far nastier and more 
pernicious, even if the actual number of deaths were low.

##I've really lost track of this indentation idea...
A lot of yanks viewed it in terms of British colonialism/imperialism;
that they were interfering in Ireland for their own advantage the way
they had meddled in our country.  Of course, nobody stopped to ask what
exactly what the Crown would gain from such a policy; NI is not exactly
a financial powerhouse, nor does it export any goods not available
elsewhere.  People viewed it as "having territory for bragging rights".
And of course, ppl couldn't really relate to terrorism before 9/11; it
was too abstract, too unimaginable.

[Jimmy]
#[Jimmy] :3:
A big part of the problem is that a lot of people in Ireland, North and 
South, on both sides, have been fed a load of bullshit packaged as history. 
I won't go into this in detail, because it's too tiring. I proofread part 
of a very good (though more than slightly biased towards the British side) 
account, written at the time that Irish Home Rule was being discussed, for 
Distributed Proofreaders, which debunks several of the myths of Irish 
"history". I'll send you a link when it's posted. 

[Sluggo]
#[Sluggo] :2:
That's what I thought when I went to NI, but I left with a very 
different impression, that it was a "made in Ireland" problem.  I
visited Scotland and England immediately afterward and found the Brits,
rather than anxious about losing the territory and their prestige,
instead wishing the NI problem would just go away.  As my friend in
Bristol (a British nationalist) put it, "I'd be happy to give Northern
Ireland independence *today* if it meant no more subsidies from our
treasury."

[Jimmy]
#[Jimmy] :3:
It's not really a made in Ireland problem, as such. There's a bit of the 
same sentiment in Scotland. 

[Sluggo]
#[Sluggo] :2:
Of course, these views would be obvious to anybody putting the Irish
and British newspapers side by side.  However, most yanks have never
even gone into the foreign section of a newsstand, never heard the 
BBC, etc.

[Ben]
#[Ben] :3:
*What* foreign section of the newsstand? It's you tofu-eating,
tree-hugging, Prius-driving, Kerry-voting West Coast liberal types that
have access to such things; the rest of America gets the Fox News
version ("OK, there's a country called Russia. And maybe another one
called Iraq. We'll let you know, once a week, whether they're good or
bad.")

[Sluggo]
#[Sluggo] :2:
After the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent events, there was more
of an acceptance in America that there's two sides to the issue.
Nevertheless, I continue to see disurbing graffiti in pub bathrooms,
"IRA all the way" and the like.

Regarding the forefold increase, my NRA friend said it was Australia,
not Britian.

Dunno if they excluded political crimes from the crime statistics, but
I think they should have.  Whether location X was bombed doesn't tell
me anything about whether a mugger is likely to stalk me, which is what
I want to know.

Britain. It has always been explosives.
##Never? Am I sure?

Interesting. I wonder what the rationale behind it was. More bang for
the buck, probably - and the evidence mostly destroys itself, which
isn't the case with firearms.

[Jimmy]
#[Jimmy] :4:
#Oops. That should have said "mainland Britain".
#
I had an argument on Wikipedia once, with someone who wanted to remove the 
word "terrorist" (to be replaced with "freedom fighter") from any articles 
relating to the IRA (one of the oddities of Wikipedia's Neutral POV policy 
- since then, the article on the Provisional IRA has had a footnote added 
which justifies the use of that word at great length - see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army#Footnotes
).

Basically, the P-IRA wanted to flex its muscles at the British government, 
but did not usually wish to harm "civilians" - they used to phone ahead, 
using a codeword, and give advance warnings so civilians could be evacuated.

[Ben]
#[Ben] :2:
I did become curious about the above comparison, though. Seems that,
according to your own Telegraph, the number _has_ at least doubled
recently.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2004%2F03%2F21%2Fnmurd21.xml

[Neil]
#[Neil] :3:
Interesting. It seems worse than I thought, but that particular statistic 
could be a bit of a freak. I'd be interested in whether the full year figures 
have doubled.

[Jimmy]
#[Jimmy] :4: 
A friend, who has studied both Irish Law (heavily based on British Common Law, 
even more so than American law) and History & Politics, tells me that British 
law was changed in the past few years with regard to the reporting of crime -- 
if I were to report something stolen, for example, and then discover it had 
merely been misplaced, it would still be reported as a crime -- so that even 
minor crimes, even those that are /not/ crimes, are reported as incridents of
crime. With this in mind, it's not surprising that crime in Britain seems to 
be on the rise. 

[Ben Whyte]
#[Ben Whyte] :5:
Also mobile phone companies require you to report your phone lost to the 
police which gets recorded as a crime even if you loose it.

Same applies to wallets, credit cards etc. 
#
##This was a much earlier message... grr.
##I suck at this.
#[Ben] :5:
#Property crimes in the UK, AFAIK, have been higher than those in the US
#for quite a long time; not a recent phenomenon at all.
#
#http://www.nationmaster.com/cat/Crime

[Ben]
##Earlier still!
#[Ben] :3:
Not from what I saw; however, criminologists in the UK and the US both
are pointing out that murders are on the rise on your side of the pond,
while property crimes have long been higher than the US. The
conservatives (European ones, anyway) like to point to the influx of
foreigners and the formation of minority gangs. I don't know enough to
say one way or the other, myself.
#
#[Jimmy] :4: 
#Well, as I said, there are a lot of Jamaican gangs in Britain at the moment. 
#
#[Ben] :5:
#I've heard similar reports from Switzerland and France, as well.

[Neil]
#[Neil] :4:
Just looking back at the Telegraph article, the figures in it show a drop, 
followed by a rise. Although it seems to have doubled over a 1 year period, 
the rise over 3 years is 50%, still too much, but nothing like the 4 times 
increase over a couple of years implied by the original message. The 
statistics in the article are:

{{
Q4 2000: 40 murders 
Q4 2001: 43 murders 
Q4 2002: 31 murders 
Q4 2003: 61 murders
}}

I don't think that establishes a definite trend.

[Ben]
#[Ben] :2:
Some commentators are indeed tying it to disarming the population, and
pointing out that, e.g., New Hampshire - where the average truck driver
carries more firepower than entire EU armies - has a _very_ low crime
and murder rate. Kennesaw county (Georgia) which had (and probably still
does) a *mandatory gun possession requirement* maintained a zero violent
crime count for many years. The Swiss probably don't do too bad either.

[Neil]
#[Neil] :3:
Well tying British changes in crime rate to disarming the population is 
bullshit. The British population has never had much in the way of guns. I 
don't think anybody I know has ever owned a more powerful weapon than an air 
pistol. (Not quite true, I once knew someone with a crossbow.)

As for the wider issues the correlation between gun ownership and violent 
crime just isn't there. You can find examples of high guns, high crime, high 
guns, low crime and low guns, low crime. I'm wouldn't expect there to be any 
low guns, high gun crime examples out there, but that may depend on what you 
are counting. Illegal guns are ususally much harder to count than legal ones 
and definitions of what constitutes high gun crime may vary.

[Ben]
#[Ben] :3:
There's a bit of circular reasoning in the above... no, you're not going
to have high gun crimes in a society with a low gun count. By the same
exact token, then, you can't tie the number of murders in, say,
Washington DC, to the availability of guns. The US, in places, is a
violent society; guns are certainly not a cause - although they may be
part of the effect.

Laws only affect the law-abiding.

#[Neil] :3:
Even criminals obey a lot of laws and laws may have indirect effects on 
criminals. No doubt the NRA would argue that Kennesaw County was an example 
of the latter.

Gun Law Ordinances
#The City's most famous ordinance adopted in March 1982 reads as follows. 

Sec. 34-1 Heads of households to maintain firearms.

(a) In order to provide for the emergency management of the City, and further 
in order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare 
of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the City 
limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition therefore.

(b) Exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who 
suffer a physical or mental disability, which would prohibit them from using 
such a firearm. Further exempt from the effect of this section are those heads 
of households who are paupers or who conscientiously oppose maintaining 
firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine, or persons convicted 
of a felony.

By definition, they do not obey the laws which make them into criminals.
A murderer may not have too many traffic tickets - but this does not
make him any less of a murderer.

We all live in societies that allow - in fact, reward - murder when it
is done under the auspices of the government, as warfare. If it is
moral then, why would it be immoral otherwise?... by such a model of
"morality", which has now been trained into thousands of young men and
women by Bush, Blair, and the rest, we've just created a large pool of
people who are restrained from murder by a very thin veneer of
civilization.

As if we hadn't learned enough from Vietnam...

[Sluggo]
#[Sluggo] :4:
Egads, and a neoconservative told me recently, "The protesters think it's
still 1968 and never learned the main lesson of Vietnam: all dissent
STOPS when war is declared."

[Ben]
#[Ben] :5:
... well, no, that's not _the_ most stupid thing I've ever heard. I can
think of one that was worse. Two, if I concentrate really hard.

Dissent only exists and makes sense when there's something to dissent
*from*. Nobody needs to march in the streets and shout for the sun to
shine. And the *main* lesson of Vietnam was that our politicians are
perfectly willing and fully able to casually murder our young men and
women - as well as those of "the enemy" - based on outright lies, and
are perfectly capable of abandoning them after shoving them into an
inferno. Cam Ranh Bay, WMDs - the lie can change, but the basic facts
remain.

For that matter, I wish it _was_ the late '60s in political terms: 

"In his inaugural address, President Richard M. Nixon asked the American
people to lower their voices, to search for unity instead of
divisiveness, for harmony instead of discord. The speech struck a
responsive note in an exhausted nation that had just lived through a
year of violence and turmoil..." ¬¬

[Sluggo]
#[Sluggo] :4:
Funny, I learned a completely different lesson from Vietnam.  That is,
"Be suspicious of anything your government is doing."

[Ben]
#[Ben] :5:
Odd how you're not the only one who learned that lesson... to my sorrow,
not enough people have learned it, though. Although the current
administration is doing all they can to drive it home.

[Neil]
#[Neil] :1:
The source of the increases we have had is probably enormous quantities of 
cheap weapons being exported from the the former Soviet Union. Changes in the 
law have made no difference that I can see, other than closing down 
legitimate shooting clubs, due to public hysteria.

Is London crime worse than New York? Well New York is supposed to have 
improved enormously, but there are few areas of London I would feel unsafe 
walking in at night. How about New York?

[Sluggo]
#[Sluggo] :2:
My totally subjective impression has been the following:

{{
  - Menacing, as in watch your back:
    - Moscow (1995/1996)
    - London (1998/2000/2002)
    - Los Angeles (2001)

  - Safe:
    - NYC (2003/2004, although I didn't venture into Harlem or the Bronx)
    - Chicago (2002/2003, although I didn't venture to the south side projects)
    - San Francisco (1998/2003/2004)
    - St Petersburg (1995/1996)
    - Rheinland in Germany, Liege in Belgium (2000)
    - Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC, Toronto, Halifax, and everywhere smaller
    - England (Bristol, Manchester, Brighton, Blackpool, Cambridge -- 2002)
      Although my mate has had trouble in Bristol.
    - Scotland (1998/2000/2002)
    - Ireland, N Ireland (2000)
}}

Daytime/nighttime doesn't seem to make much difference.  The menace I've
felt is mostly in the daytime; e.g., in Hollywood and south LA you never
know when some tough might appear who wants to mug/gangbang you.  London
has that same sense sometimes, or at least parts of it do.

#[Ben] :3:
[laugh] Especially when the two of us ambled down the street, discussing

#[Sluggo] :4:
And you said 'tis nobler to run away than fight, and one should fight
only if the person persues you and leaves you no other choice.  That
blew my mind, even though I recognized the martial arts philosophy
behind it.  The western (ahem, skinhead) mindset is quite different,
"Fight immediately and never run away."  

My philosophy is somewhere between the two.

[Jimmy]

rather not start a fight after all  :) 

[Ben]
#[Ben] :6:
"Listen, we can both walk away from this and go home - dinner,
girlfriends, quiet night's sleep, and so on. The other choice is where
one of us can go to the emergency room or the morgue, and the other one
gets hauled off by the Gardai for inhuman cruelty, vicious mutilation,
and possibly cannibalism. Let's just do the first one instead of ruining
each other's lives, OK?"

Wanna elaborate for the benefit of TAG?

[Jimmy]
#[Jimmy] :7:
Sending conflicting messages with body language is a major part of it -- 
for example, when someone doesn't want a fight, they put their hands up, 
palms open and facing outward to show that they're not a threat. I do 
this, but move into a fighting stance. I also keep my hands at throat 
height, fingers pointing at the throat -- if I only get one shot, it's 
going to count, and I don't mind telegraphing that.

Another aspect is facial expression and voice tone -- with both, I try 
to express surprise that someone wants to start a fight with me; my 
words say "I'm sure we can work this out" while my face and tone of 
voice say "because you /really/ don't want to fuck with me".

I don't want to give away *all* of my secrets though :) (There's at 
least one thing that's hard to explain anyway (I only put the pieces 
together a couple of days ago, and even harder to reproduce).

an option for me: I'm not much of a runner.

[Ben]
[nod] I always wondered about those folks who went deer-hunting during
the shotgun season. Sure, there are such things as sabots, but most of
the ones I'd talked to were just using slugs. What did they do, go
scrape the deer off the trees afterwards and freeze the puree for the
winter?

[Vince]
If you are in a situation of a screwed up bull moose or bear... a 22 don't cut 
it...  Generally I borrow my neighbors 50 caliber for that...

[Ben]
Nice. Black powder, I presume? I've seen a few firearms that would toss
the modern .50 a few miles, but those are pretty expensive and somewhat
unusual. Sure would stop a moose, though...

!!nuclearjava|Java should not be trusted with nukes, Microsoft says!!

[Jason]
I was looking through the Microsoft EULA[1] to see what kind of disclaimer
they had and found pretty much the standard stuff. (ie, "We could use
this software to kill your cat, and it wouldn't be our fault.") But
there was one clause that I found...interesting:

9. NOTE ON JAVA SUPPORT. THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT MAY CONTAIN SUPPORT FOR
PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN JAVA. JAVA TECHNOLOGY IS NOT FAULT TOLERANT AND IS
NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR RESALE AS ON-LINE
CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE
PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT
NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE
SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF JAVA
TECHNOLOGY COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE
PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

Interesting, no?

[1] Specifically, this was the EULA that Midtown Madness, a Microsoft
game, shipped under.

[Jimmy]
Actually, no. This is part of Java's licence. Microsoft licenced Java 
from Sun, rather than writing their own implementation, which is why Sun 
were able to sue them for making changes to their version of Java.

[Ben]
Amusingly, I wrote an article for Java Developer's Journal a couple 
of years ago - "Java Under Linux: Ten Feet Tall and Bullet-Proof" -
that began with the very clause you quote, and made that very point.
Got quite a number of comments about it, too.

less trouble than the old one; it's scarcely possible to give _more._

[Jimmy]
And there you go tempting fate again. It's getting to be a hobby.

[Ben]
Ah. I *was* just wondering how they measured the length of, e.g., the
Mesozoic era. The above setup makes it trivial: turn it on, and when
it's finished booting - voila! - continental drift and such have
occurred in not only measurable but gross amounts.

And our capacity for self-torture is nearly infinite as well... Perhaps
I *am* getting a bit wiser as I get older, but I'm becoming rather aware
of the "tar babies" in my life, and am quite emphatic about shedding
them or even avoiding getting involved with them in the first place.
This, of course, presumes the ability to afford such solutions.

[Brian]
I had to come home, compile some software, then use gdb and strace to
try to get it working, just to get rid of the shakes.

Given that we had our tornado in California (anyone else remember the
Mary Avenue touchdown in Sunnyvale, about 4 years ago? Half a block
away!), earthquakes a-plenty, hurricane Isabel last year here on the
right coast ... Volcanos are next on the list, and after working on that
Windows box, I might welcome the change.

[Ben]
I find that hurricanes often suffice to put an end to nasty electronic
creatures that refuse to die in any other way; I've just replaced a
10-year old GPS that sang its swan song (reasons unknown) during the
last one. Oh, my hand-held GPS went along - misery loves company, I
suppose - and so did my iPaq handheld. They say that hurricanes are
necessary because they strip the coating of old, dead organisms off the
coral beds, which allows the coral to breathe and grow; I can assure you
that it strips old electronics off boats just as efficiently.
Presumably, this allows GPS manufacturers to breathe and grow...

I had this in the Laundrette draft:

Murphy's Law has been formalised:
http://www.news.com.au/common/printpage/0,6093,11009375,00.html

((U+C+I) x (10-S))/20 x A x 1/(1-sin(F/10))

where U=urgency, C=complexity, I=importance, S=skill, A=aggravation, and
F=frequency; each is a value between 1 and 9, except A, which is set at 0.7.

"There is, of course, a Sod's Law factor to the equation. If you judge your 
ratings wrongly, you might become too optimistic - and calamity will strike." 

[Ben]
Just as it will if you base anything important on the above formula.
Never forget that Murphy's Law is _also_ subject to Murphy's Law.

[John]
I.e., it's recursive! 

##bq

Thus a close relative of the GNU/Linux clan: A self-referential,
empirically reentrant and recursing formula. Yes, recursing.

[Ben]
*Precisely* the word that fits the situation, on occasion (when simply
cursing isn't enough.)

[Brian]
Wasn't there a whole section of Hofstadter's GEB devoted to this?

[Ben]
I need to pick up a copy; it's probably about time. Certain books should
be reread every few years. As an example, I've just reread Pirsig's
ZATAOMM - my fourth reading of it or so - and was struck, *again*, by
how much that book has influenced my life and attitudes in general since
the first time. More so with the passing years.
##end bq

[Jimmy]
Yep. That didn't stop me from trying to brush up my C with two versions of a 
program to calculate that  :) 

[Ben]
Heh. Makes sense to play with with the simpler stuff before you dive
into the dark depths of Moria (watch out for that Balrog; he's still
wandering around somewhere down there.)

[Jimmy]
Here's the short version.
# murphy-simple.c

[Ben]
Let me give it a shot - I haven't done any Perl for a while now, too
bloody long.

#``
{{
 #!/usr/bin/perl -w

@vals = qw/urgency complexity importance skill frequency/;

die "5 arguments required: (@vals)\n" unless @ARGV == 5;

for (@ARGV){
        die "Each argument must be between 1 and 9\n" unless /^[1-9]$/;
}

 # YANETUT
@v{ map chr ord, @vals } = @ARGV;

printf "%3.3f\n", ( ( $v{u} + $v{c} + $v{i} ) * ( 10 - $v{s} ) ) / 20 *
        0.7 * ( 1 / ( 1 - sin( $v{f} / 10 ) ) );
}}
#''

There. I figure _that's_ the short version...  :) 

[Jimmy]
Or, the Perl NQ1L
{{
perl -e'@i=@ARGV;print((($i[0]+$i[1]+$i[2])*(10-$i[3]))/20*0.7*(1/(1-sin($i[4]/10))))' 5 6 7 8 9
}}

[Ben]
Oh. Well, heck, if we're going to do _that..._

#``
{{
perl -alne'print((($F[0]+$F[1]+$F[2])*(10-$F[3]))/20*.7*(1/(1-sin($F[4]/10))))'
1 2 3 4 5
2.42040302288669
#''
}}

Or we could just eliminate "print" altogether, just for fun - although
the first version is shorter:

#``
{{
perl -alpe's#.*#((($F[0]+$F[1]+$F[2])*(10-$F[3]))/20*.7*(1/(1-sin($F[4]/10))))#e'
1 2 3 4 5
2.42040302288669
#''
}}

#Ben again
...or, shortest yet:

#``
{{
perl -alpe'$_=((($F[0]+$F[1]+$F[2])*(10-$F[3]))/20*.7*(1/(1-sin($F[4]/10))))'
#''
}}

#Ben, yet again
Oh yeah - and we can get rid of all that LISP-looking stuff, too.

#``
{{
perl -alpe'$_=($F[0]+$F[1]+$F[2])*(10-$F[3])/20*.7*(1/(1-sin$F[4]/10))'
#''
}}

*Now* it's shortest. I think.  :)  It's somewhere around the 18th hole of
Perl golf, anyway.

[Brad]
I wonder if Woomert or Frink would ever alias this in their ~/.bashrc...

[Ben]
Woomert would probably spotted the tortured math stuff and made it even
shorter thereby:

{{
perl -pale'$_=($F[0]+$F[1]+$F[2])*(10-$F[3])/20*.7/(1-sin$F[4]/10)'
}}

Other than that, it could happen...

Acer has replaced my previous lemon^Wlaptop with a newer model,

Actually, I'd expect it to be "bright yellow for Golden Delicious,
bright green for Granny Smith", if anything. I mean, the company's
called _Apple,_ for Ghu's sake. The *last* thing they'd want to imply is
that they were selling lemons.

I've actually considered buying an Apple, primarily because of their
history (in my experience and reports from others) of reliability. On
the other hand, I understand that Linux on Macs still has a few rough
edges... and having seen the spindled, folded, and mutilated version of
BSD used by OS/X, I'm not willing to go that way, either.

(Yeccch. It was that much nastier because I actually _like_ BSD.)

[Ben]
an
Aspire 2012... although I'd be hard-put to say anything especially
exciting and wonderful about it. Yeah, the video controller is different
(an RV350/Radeon 9600 instead of the 9200 that was in it previously);
other than that, it's missing the LCD one-line display and the weird
"multimedia" setup that (theoretically) allowed you to play CDs, DVDs,
etc. without actually booting the machine (I've mentioned this; it was a
tiny Linux partition with "mplayer".) [shrug] No loss, AFAIC. On the
other hand, the Intel wireless 2100 interface has been upgraded to a
2200G - which handles A, B, and G, something I do see as an improvement.
They also seem to have resolved the extremely weird "key delay" problem
that the Aspire 2003 had (if you typed too quickly, pressing 'b'
immediately after 'a' would result in a second 'a'!) Otherwise, it looks
and acts much the same as the old gadget.

Let's see how this one holds up...

Beware the Fencepost Error, son -
The j's that bite, the i's that catch...

Me, I dislike even the idea of loops where you have to keep the index
manually; I think that the concept itself is broken (and yes, it's a
requirement in C, given its data structures - and the right thing to
practice if you're going to be using it.) 

[Jason]
I agree; I really think it should be the compiler's job to figure where
something starts and ends, and how we can iterate over each element in
turn. It's not hard. But this is C we're talking about:

}}

 :-) 

[Ben]
This may or may not be
indicative, but I haven't used a loop of the above type - even though
Perl supports it - ever since I learned Perl, except to explain them
(and deprecate their use) to my students. If I *had* to use it for some
reason, I'd at least let the compiler handle the exit condition:

{{
#``
for (i=6; i;) in[i] = atoi(argv[i--]); 
#''
}}

[Jason]
Just looking at this, I can't figure out what it's supposed to do. What
is the value of "i" when used as "in[i]"? Does it get the old value of
"i" or the new value?  I think it's undefined how C should handle this.
At least gcc doesn't like it:

{{
#``
~/prog/c$ cat post-increment-operator.c
 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
        int i = 0;
        printf("i: %d, i++: %d\n", i, i++);
        return 0;
}
~/prog/c$ gcc -Wall post-increment-operator.c -o post-increment-operator
}}

#bq
[Ben]
[shrug] "-Wall" is a maiden aunt on the edge of a nervous breakdown.
IMO, most of what it complains about never comes to pass. 
#
#[Jason]
#*nods* I've compiled software packages that spit out reams of warnings,
#only to have the program run flawlessly.

[Ben]
That's not to
say that it's not useful at times, but paying scrupulous attention to
every one of its hysterical pronouncements of doom isn't a good
strategy. As an example, I've _never_ seen a kernel compile that didn't
generate a stack of warnings - and yet, all but one or two worked fine.

[Jason]
Or, for that matter, compiling almost any large software project seems
to generate a pile of warnings. And, yes, most of the time, everything
works fine.

But a quick check over at the comp.lang.c FAQ reveals that such a
statement is indeed undefined:

http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/q3.1.html
http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/q3.2.html

[Brad]
I use -Wall because I can't stand streams of silly warnings; they
force me to write better code and more maintainable code. This, IMO,
is a Good Thing.
#
#[Jason]
#Same here.

[Ben]
Oh, I'm all for enabling warnings - I don't write Perl code (other than
Perl Golf) without "-w" or "use warnings", and anything over 10 lines
gets "use strict" as well. I just think that "-Wall" goes _way_
overboard... but I guess it's more of a response to the way that C
itself is rather than twitchiness on the part of the developers.
Whenever blowing your nose has a perceptible chance of destroying the
entire Universe, a bit of reticence becomes understandable.

[Ben]
Whups, 'ccmakedep' snuck in where only compilers belong. Otherwise,
seems like none of them had a problem - and the program output was
exactly the same in all cases.

[Jason]
When I said "different compiler", I had in mind non-gcc based compilers.
So, just to see what a different compiler would do, I downloaded tcc
(http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc/) and compiled the program. Exactly
the same output as gcc. Hmmm.

So, I'll change my assertion from "the minute" to "five years into a
project, after you've ported it to 10 platforms, you're probably going
to get different results."  :-) 

[Ben]
[grin] Sounds reasonable.

[Jason]
But seriously, I think that if you're using C, you should avoid that
type of construct, because you don't know how the compiler is going to
define it. You can find out how *this* compiler defines it, and maybe
all the compilers you use do it the same way. But maybe it will change
in the new version; maybe you need to use a different compiler.

Coding in C is like playing with fire. You do one thing wrong, and BAM!
Segfault, or worse, obscure bug, or worse yet, undetected security hole.
I think using a construct whose behavior is undefined makes it more
likely that you'll get "one thing wrong".

Just my 2 cents.

[Ben]
Oh, I agree. It's why I avoid coding in C anymore; haven't done it for
years now. I've come to believe that the terms "fragile" and
"programming" shouldn't be allowed near each other, whereas C plans the
wedding, sends out the invitations, and writes the piranha-infested
prenuptial agreement.

[Jason]
Heh heh, I keep forgetting that the best possible C coding practice is
"Don't".

There are advantages to not being a TV-watcher. I've managed not ever 
to have heard that tune.

[Jimmy]
You lucky bastard. That's one of the biggest disadvantages of being a 
parent -- the rubbish that kids watch [1]. Most recently, I told my son 
I'd take him to the cinema and regretted it -- I thought he'd want to 
see "Shark Tale", but instead he made me sit through "YuGiOh - The 
Movie" (a movie based around a lesser Magic: The Gathering clone with 
dialogue that serves only to explain the game and the properties of each 
card).

[Brian]

[Jimmy]
My son has become a mini-Linux advocate since he found out that it was 
used to make the Harry Potter films :)

[Jimmy]
[1] Though obviously not the programmes I watched when I was a kid -- we 
had quality TV in my day[2].

[Brian]
I've a number of friends who assure me that Shark Tale is quite good. At
least one such, sadly unburdened by rug rats, still has gone to see it
at least three times.

[Jimmy]
Yeah. Both Pixar and Dreamworks have made some great computer animated 
films. "Finding Nemo" is probably the best of the bunch. "Toy Story" was 
great, but it'll forever be marred for me, because of the guy who was 
sitting in the same row as my then-girlfriend and me who was enjoying it 
a bit too much.

[Jason]
I don't know about the rest of you, but whenever I see a CG movie, I
can't help thinking things like: "Wow! Look how good they did the
water!" or "Haha! It's just a flat textured surface!"

[Brian]
I've assured him that the next time I go to see a cartoon in the movies,
it'll be an hour plus of collected Wylie Coyote shorts. Effectively that
means never, as there are too many non-PC references, making Warner's
lawyers alternate between quivering in fear and salivating at the
prospective fees, win or lose.

[Jimmy]
Most, if not all, of them are available on VHS, so that + TV tuner card 
+ DVD burner + http://linuxgazette.net/issue83/stoddard.html = Wile E. 
Coyote, the collected works.

[Jimmy]
[2] I'm too young to be using phrases like "in my day" -- another 
disadvantage.

[Brian]
You're NEVER too young to use the phrase "in my day". For instance, in
the third grade, when your brother is coming into first grade for his
first day, this is appropriate: "In my day, they used to glue your
thingy closed if you asked to go to the bathroom too many times. You'll
be fine, I"m sure..." I think he's blocked out the memory of that day.

[Jimmy]
Good point. My youngest sister started Secondary school this year and 
had to be briefed on the various things my brothers and I did so she 
wouldn't be surprised about the extra surveillance.

[Brian]
There are times, however, when it's not prudent: At the birth of your
daughter's first child, "In my day we just screamed a few times, popped
the babies out, and went back to work in the fields." Remember that
she's lying in an OR setting with plenty of sharp instruments around.

[Jimmy]
Heh. Reminds me of when my son was born - I was, until then, blissfully 
unaware of such things as vacuum deliveries or episiotomies and in the 
hour-long seconds when my newly delivered little boy spent showing no 
signs of life I had measured the distances between me, nearest sharp 
object, and doctor's throat.

[Brian]
Then there's the "In my day" sayings that refer to times that should be
forever forgotten: "In my day we wore white polyester and vinyl, and we
were happy to do so." Statements like that are conversation killers.

[Jimmy]
Erm... yes.

/me slowly backs away.

[Brian]
.brian (who remembers to add the X-Gazette-Tag about 50% of the time)

[Jimmy]
I think we're off-topic enough for that to not matter :)

[Breen]
I plan to keep it that way, too...

[Ben]
On the other hand, I won't be writing any device drivers in Perl.
(Contrariwise, one of my former students designed a website back-end
database that uses "grep" plus an odd directory structure, and it turned
out to be consistently faster than MySQL. Go figure.)

[[
Earlier in this thread...
]]

[Ben]
or, since this is a "single-use" loop (as I recall it) -

{{
##Erm...maybe I should change my <pre> thingy
#``
int i = 6;
while (i) in[i] = atoi(argv[i--]);
#''
}}

[Jason]
Essentially the same loop as before, so the same problem. I'm not 100%
sure that the C standard says it's undefined, but at the very least, it
strikes me as not the best coding style for C.

[Ben]
[grin] Oh, certainly not. It's just me and my prejudices.

[Jason]
Oh! Do you mean, that because of our different (programming) language
background, we would of course code in C using styles from the other
language that we are most familiar?

[Ben]
Computers are supposed to work hard so we don't have to, dammit.

[Jason]
C is not my "first language", so I don't try to take too many shortcuts,
for fear of getting lost. For instance:

{{
#``
~/prog/c$ grep '!= 0' *.c
atime-check.c:          if(stat(filename, &fileinfo) != 0) {
atime-check.c:          if(stat(filename, &fileinfo) != 0) {
findmagic.c:        if(stat(filename, &fileinfo) != 0) {
findmagic.c:                if(strcmp(filetype, "data") != 0)
link.c: if(syscall(__NR_link, argv[1], argv[2]) != 0) {
listdir.c:      DIE_IF(closedir(d) != 0);
loop.c: if(pipe(fds) != 0)
~/prog/c$ 
#''
}}

It doesn't really make sense to say that in C ever because true is
basically defined as "not zero".  And yet I say it anyway, because I
always have to think twice whenever I see

{{
#``
if(variable)
        do_stuff();
#''
}}

<shrug> It's a style issue. I don't think correct behavior should be a
side-effect.

[Ben]
Heh. No, it's supposed to be a language-enforced feature, in something
supposedly as clearly-defined as C. In practice, well, that's a
different story.
#
#[Brad]
#True. In the case of counter variables, I prefer to use the prefix
#incrementor/decementor, i.e.
#{{
#printf("i is %d\n", --i);
#}}
#
#which returns the decremented value and then sets i:
#{{
#int prefix_decrementor_1(int i)
#{
#       int j;
#
#       j = j - 1;
#       return j;
#}
#int prefix_decrementor_2(int *i, int j)
#{
#      *i = j;
#      return i;
#}
#
#int count = 5;
#printf("count is %d\n", prefix_decrementor_1(count));
#prefix_decrementor_2(&count);
#}}
#
#[Jason]
#Your definition for prefix_decrementor_2 takes two args...

[Brad]
As you said, it's a CodingStyle thing, but I find that "when in doubt,
use prefix". It tends to help when you SIGSEGV in a loop and can't
figure out why  ;) 

[Jason]
Yeah, I try to use the prefix form as much as I can. When I *want*
strange side effects, I'll *ask* for it, thankyouverymuch.  :) 

[Ben]
Yup. "When in doubt, write it out" is not a bad strategy for avoiding a
certain class of problems in C coding. This, of course, is
self-defeating to a degree - more lines means more debugging and
increases the chance of a typo - but that's what "lint", "-Wall" and so
on are for.

[Sluggo]
"zayebis'!" popped into my head the other day for some reason.  Doesn't it
mean, "get the fuck out of here"?

[Ben]
Nope - "get fucked", or literally "go fuck (yourself) to death".
However, depending on the tone, it has several other meanings; the most
common one, generally used with an aggravated intonation, or sorta
chanted by enunciating the individual syllables, is "aww, *fuck*!"

[Sluggo]
It's been a few years since I've heard it.  Don't ppl also say it when
their hockey team scores?

So how do you say get the fuck outta here?  "Ot''ebis'"?  Or just,
"Skatert'yu dorogu?"  ("The road is nicely laid out in front of you.")

When I was in North Carolina in August, I asked my friend who they blame
all their problems on.  In Seattle we blame everything on Californians
and Californication.  He said, "We blame it on yankees."  And he said,
"Whenever a yank voices a sentiment about not liking Raleigh, ppl will
offer to come to his house and help him pack his stuff."  All Southern
polite-like.  I said, "In Seattle the equivalent is, 'The freeway
entrances are clearly marked'."  (And Emmett Watson, who used to write a
newspaper column discouraging tourists, wrote exactly that.)  My friend
said that's *way* too direct for a southerner to say.  He tried to
explain southern politeness to me, but I don't think I got it coz I
haven't seen it much.  He said the angrier guys get, the politer they
become.  I said, "That's a far cry from the gun-toutin' nascar
individualist redneck you usually hear about in the south."  He said
there's that too, and that's why ppl are so polite.  It's a coping
mechanism to prevent situations from getting out of hand.  Have you seen
that?  I have a feeling he directed some of that politeness toward me
sometimes but it went right over my head since I don't think that way.

What about, "Ni figa sebe".  Wherever did that come from?  "Not a fig to
itself."  Never made sense.  I hear ppl say it when their hockey team
wins, and I even saw a little girl say it in a Soviet movie when she
saw a real live automobile at the gate.  (It was set in the 1940s.)

[Ben]
Interesting diff between Russian and English: in the latter, when you're
"fucking around" with something, you're usually playing with it. In the
former, you're working yourself, or _being_ worked, to death over it.


Two tankers are struggling with a broken track, on a hot day, and
getting nowhere. A fairy godmother appears - poof! - out of thin air.

"What are you doing, boys?" ¬¬
"Ah, /yebemsya/..." ¬¬

"Sure!!!"

spend several years configuring the incredibly complex operation of
it, perhaps buy a new computer because the current one isn't powerful
enough... it _is_ quite the hassle, I understand. :/

other running programs and so on recursively (*).
