Wait. What? There's traffic on this list?!  I've only been seeing emails from

We did for a while whilst Rick had several things to attend to.  But
now that he is thankfully OK and back in one piece, and able to
administer the machine hosting mailman, I am not sure what's happening
to the Yahoo Group -- I presume they'll be left to stagnate until such
time that if we ever need them again, we can just do so -- as most of
the "key" people are already subscribed anyhow.

Good to see you here. Now that I know what it takes to drag you out of
hibernation, I guess I'll have to schedule one... erm, whatever you'd
like to call this... per week or so.

Wo-oh. Have you been subbed to some 'Rick-only' list all this time?
We've had <strong>everything</strong> here recently: Linux questions, non-Linux
answers, giant flying multicolored turnips (that may have been the day I
was taking my pain medication, though...) rhubarb [1], and so on.

Either the leaves or the stems are poisonous, so you shouldn't eat
whichever one is the poisonous part. And whatever you do, don't eat
the top part of the stem where it meets the leaves -- no matter which
part of the plant is poisonous, there will be some poison where they
meet. At least if you pick leaves or stems you have a 50/50 chance.

It's true.  Rhubarb happens to me my most favourite fruit.  We used to
grow it in our garden, and it's really tasty.

I wasn't alive during WWII -- but my grandparents were.  My
grandmother recounted to me on several occasions how rhubarb prepared
in this way was considered a "sweet" -- it was a nice treat, due to
all the good rationing which was in place at the time.

Do you like crumbles?  That's why rhubarb is used -- its nice savoury
flavour compliments the sweet crumble (and custard if added).
Delicious.  I often add a little lemon juice into the rhubarb and some
apple as well.  You can also add currants if you like.

I was laughing at the nonchalent way that the author mentioned the
poisonous nature of rhubarb - take your chances - if it doesn't kill
you, you'll love it.

Rhubarb is far too sour to eat raw, I'm convinced that it will
dissolve the enamel on my teeth and most likely eat it's way through
my stomach lining.

Rhubarb crumble is the very best way to eat it. It's beautiful with
pears too. My old Nan swore that stewed rhubarb and custard was a gift
from God.

Ack!  Even without toxins, the pucker-power aspects would lead one
to not try that twice.
</p>

<p>
Just so you know, our vegetable garden at Chez Moen includes several
rhubarb patches.  The stems (without leaves) -- which are entirely safe --
get cooked by yrs. truly in some pies that seem to meet with wide
approval.  
</p>

<p>
Anyway, getting even ill at all, much less seriously so, from ingesting
the oxalic acid and other toxins in rhubarb leaves and flowers would
require a dedicated effort at self-injury, as the concentration's just
not very high.

Oh, dear. I don't want to get a reputation as a Corrupter of the

Ouch! I think I had a similar reaction to durian, last time I tried to
have any - although it wasn't in reaction to poison. I think my face
stayed twisted in a grimace of horror and disbelief for about three
weeks. Mind you, I'd eaten the stuff before, a number of times; I just
happen to think that I've reached my lifetime quota, and my "durian
exposure meter" is pegged.

In one of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, she relates the story of serving dessert
from 'pie plant' without sugar. The first one to taste it added a couple of
tablespoons ...
