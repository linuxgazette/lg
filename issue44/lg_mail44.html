<BR>Subject: You to can be a secret agent

<P> I need help in setting up web kiosks for a free-net I'll be
setting up in rural Nicaragua this September. When I took on
the job, I didn't have a day job at a startup company. Now I 
do, and I haven't had any time to actually do the programming. 
What I need is help writing 2-3 system and mail admin programs
with a cgi front end. The tools should be in PHP3 &amp; or perl,
and be set up so they can easily be localized. I'm willing to pay for the
work, and the final web kiosk distribution will be released under
a combination GPL/artistic license. 

<P> An example of what I need done is to have a cgi for sneakernet delivery of
mail. The CGI should scan a list of
qmail maildirs, figure out which ones have mail &amp; provide a 
list to the user. The user can then click on a link, and the maildir will be
re-delivered to a new maildir on floppy disk. The script needs to be able to
handle checking for floppy/ formatting floppy/ spanning the maildir
accross multiple floppies.

<BR>Subject: Linux server, Mac &amp; Win clients

<P> Recently, I acquired the job(pro bono) of consolodating a small(12
clients) non-profit's networks. Currently, they have two seperate
networks, one using Appletalk with 7 Macs sharing a printer and the
other NT 4.0 w/ 4 PC's and 2 Powermacs doing file and printer sharing.
All the CLients have seperate dial-up internet accounts except one PC
which has a cable modem(don't ask me why they don't all use it). I
suspect the former tech pushed them into NT w/o informing them of the
need and cost for Microsoft Outlook and Exchange.

<P> I would like to consolodate them onto a single linux server doing
email/file/printer sharing and connect theough a shared DSL line. I
purchased Red Hat 6.0 for the task. Unfortunately, I have never used
Linux before so when it scomes to altering config files I get lost. I
have read alot of How-to's on setting up Samba and Netatalk seperately,
but never have come accross an article about setting them up together.
Is ther fine tuning invovled to get them to work together? Is there a
simple answer to this with walk through help? Also, they all currently
use Netscape browser, what software should I use to transfer email
internally and externally?

<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<BR>

<BR>Subject: Linux

<P> Hi my name is Steve from Tulsa Ok.

<P> Iam sick of windows 95, 98 and Gates, and the way he has control of every
thing makes me sick. If he had a good product I might feel different. At
first I could not under stand how he has control of the market with a piece
of junk, but now I know why. I know, and alot of other people know that
UNIX is a very good system. Not every body knows that Linux is a newer
Versions of UNIX made for PC's. And with more investigation you find out
there is about twenty different brands of Linux all looking like they are
better than each other. 

<P> Which one is the best,  who is biggest, who has
been around longest, who has the most support, who is the most stable, I
think REDHAT is maybe? Then every brand has several Versions out there ,
with in a small time frame ,to many too choose from, why some many
versions. That tells me that the early Versions must be bad to have to make
a new one so quick. Then you find alot of patches for different brands, and
versions ? (I don't mean to sound bad, but which one do I use.)  I think
every body would like a stable and fast system with the least amount of
overhead that has alot of support and programs will run on then  bye bye
windows95,98,??. It seems like to me that all the Linux people are after
each other instead of windows95,98,?? Then there is Freebsd that says they
are best because they dont have all the bugs. 

<P> I am so confused that maybe I should stay with windows 95,98,?? and install
and time delay relay to cycle the power to it every hour, so it can reboot like
it wants to. Please tell me more about Linux like.  Who has the most support,
whos is most stable, bottom line the best one?

<P> Thanks for your time. Steve

<P> Dear Linuxinans,

<P> I'm having a couple of problems using Linux.  My system is now Mandrake
6.0, which is claimed to be 99% compatible with RedHat 6.0.  
<OL>
	<LI> How should I edit my /etc/fstab so that regular users, including
mysef in a non-root role, can read and 'write' a dos partition?  My current
setting is '/dev/hda2  /dos  vfat  user,suid,rw,exec,dev  0 0' .  It apparently
doesn't work.
	<LI> I got a 'drive shift' phenomenon.  First, I installed Linux in a
Windows 98 system, a single hard drive system.  It contains 2 partitions for the
fat c: for the Windows itself, and d: for data files.  When I use other 2
partitions for Linux, one for / and the other for swap, it went well.  No
matter what distro it was.  Then I wanted to try separated partitions for /,
/usr and /home.  Of course, it intruded the 'no more than 4 partitions' rule. 
So I had to use an extended partition and a number of logical partitions.  When
it came to Linux, it worked fine.  The system recognized all /dev/hdax well. 
But when I boot it into Windows, my drives go crazy.  The c: is still in place,
but the d: turn out to be an 'invalid media', with an e: containg the same data
as the old d: instead.  The worst thing is that I have to press  'a' to abort
the d: reading every boot time.  How can I get rid of this drive shifting?
</OL>

	[Yes, all distributions allow you to repartition your disk after
	installation.  However, you can't delete a partition without losing the
	data in it (except maybe with third-party "resize-in-place" utilities).
	Linux requires a separate partition except in the case of the
	now-obscure UMSDOS filesystem.  I have not heard of any problems with
	PPP security.

	<STRONG>Market share</STRONG> changes quickly, but people's
	perceptions of it don't change quite so fast.  So whatever anybody
	tells you now will change in six months.  

	<P> Red Hat has for years been consideredthe biggest by far .  However,
	SuSE now claims to be roughly the same size as RH, both in terms of
	sales and employees.  Caldera has traditionally been much smaller, but
	have been very successful with their current 2.2 release, in part
	because RH raised its price and so for the first time, Caldera is
	actually <STRONG>cheaper</STRONG> than Red Hat.

	<P> After years of there being only three major distributions (RH,
	Debian and Slackware), suddenly distros are exploding from the seams.
	SuSE made it big in the US last year. Caldera and TurboLinux this year
	are now seen by many as "major" distributions.  (Especially since
	TurboLinux 
	<A HREF=htttp://www.linuxjournal.com/articles/currents/001.html>
	is outselling Win98 and MacOS in Japan</A> right now.)  I'm still not
	sure what to think about Linux-Mandrake: we'll see whether it gathers
	long-term momentum.

	<P> Distributions keep moving up and down the latter, and they will
	continue to do so.

	<P> Delving into more ancient history, Slackware was the biggest distro
	before Red Hat, and SLS before Slackware.  Each became the biggest
	because it was perceived as easier to install, more bug-free, and
	better supported than the previous standard.

	<P> Disclaimers: I haven't listed non-Intel platforms (MkLinux) because
	I don't know enough about them.  These opinions are solely my own and
	what I remember from news stories.  If anybody has hard-and-fast
	numbers about the relative market share of several distributions, and
	how they've evolved send them in and let us </EM>Gazette<EM> readers

<P> Dear Linux Geniuses!

<P> I was wondering if you could help me and my school solve out linux/Nt
networking headache.
<P> The school is running a NT4.0 server that has four network cards that are
connected to hubs that are located in the school. its IP is 10.15.16.1 and
the other cards IP's are 10.15.64.1, 10.15.48.1, 10.15.32.1, etc. The Nt
server acts as a gateway for traffic from these subnets. We are all using
DHCP assigned addresses but I reserved one for the linux box 10.15.64.7.
What I can ping is 10.15.16.1 the Server and the computers on the subnets
because I passed this route command "route add default gw 10.15.16.1" and
the it goes! The Ntserver is connected to another server running WinProxy
and it has 2 network cards, this computer handles the internet. I cannot
ping It! It's address is 10.15.0.1 the windowz boxes on the subnets can but
I cant! (dont worry my DNSes are set and everything) this Proxybox is a
router to the net it's other Ethernet card is connected to the net (complex
100mbit stuff, not important) it's IP is 10.15.88.1. I need to figure out
how to set my route in linux to be able to ping the ProxyBox and then travel
to the internet. Can you offer any advice? Also the Proxybox is running
WinProxy for web and ftp transfers...do I have to worry about it? any thing
that I am required to set?

<BR>Subject: DNS on the fly???

<P> I have my laptop configured to plug into the network of my employer. At
home, I plug my laptop into my home network, and dial out from another machine
setup for dial on demand. Unfortunately, if it takes forever waiting for the
two timeouts when trying to connect to the employer's DNS servers from home,
and if I change the DNS order, it takes just as long for the timeout error when
attempting to connect to my ISP's DNS from my employer's network. Is there an
easy way to change the DNS servers when needed? It's easy enough to change IP
addresses with the ifconfig command, is there a similar means for changing the
DNS? Or, should I just bite the bullet and setup BIND on the laptop?

<P> Hi, I am really sorry if this mail has reached the wrong plcae, but I
desparately need help. I have installed Red Hat Linux 6.0 ( Kernel 2.2.5-15 ).
I am unable to install StarOffice 5 Personal Edition. I have followed all the
steps given for StarOffice installation. I have a file named 'libc.so.6' in my
'/lib' directory which is a link to 'libc-2.1.1.so' in the same directory.
When I run the ./setup for the StarOffice installation it gives an error saying
that the installation requires glibc2.0.7 ( which is available on the CD ). So
I copy this lot of library files in to the '/lib' directory. After that when
./setup is run, it accesses the CDROM for around 5 seconds, then the hard disk
for 10 seconds and then it just comes back to the prompt, without ANY error
message. I am really frustrated with this. Be my saviour and answer my query. I
f you are not the right person to answer the query, atleast guide me by
pointing me to the right person.

<BR>Subject: help

<P> I recently installed RedHat 6.0 on an Intel box so I could inexpensively 
test Apple's QuickTime Streaming Server.  The installation of RedHat went
smoothly and seems to be working quite well on the box (a consumer Compaq
Presario).  I downloaded QTSS, configured it and proceeded to run it.  It
worked immediately.  I am having a problem that I would like to know if any
others have had.  I can directly access a streaming movie using its true
file name but I can't get it if I use the name of the reference movie.
I should be able to access the reference movie and have the server and the
QuickTime plug-in on the client machine negotiate the correct version of the
movie to serve based on the client's QT plug-in's "Connection Speed"
setting.  Based on the setting, the server chooses the appropriate movie for
the bandwidth and serves it up.

<P> That is how it is supposed to work.
When I attempt to connect using the reference movie the client connects and
then reports "415 - Unsupported Media Type".  Does anyone have a clue what
is happening?

<P> ... Now if I can just get my ppp to my MCI ISP account (which was sold to
Cable and Wireless and is now being sold to Prodigy) working. They appear
to do some sort of Challenge Response Authentication in addition to
the usual CHAP ie.: there's a prompt of "(IH08011)" (number changes session
to session) which seems to be a combined login identity request and
password challenge which is then followed by the prompt "password"
which presumably requests the password transformed by the number in
the first prompt. If I set the pap-secrets or chap-secrets file then
pppd expects to have established a ppp connection in which to encapsulate
the authentication protocols but I seem to get this challenge in a
prompt before ppp starts up so I suspect it's not just the regular CHAP.
Note a generic MSDUN has no problems with the prompt, but of course M$
doesn't have any useful documentation about what they are doing. Any
ideas? I'll probably solve the problem by switching ISP's but if anyone
has the answer, I'd like to hear it.

interface, game doors (Trade Wars, for example [!]), etc., with lots of new
stuff Coming Real Soon Now (tm). 

<P> Apparently this has struck some sort of chord, because they have had
hundreds of new users on the first day, with lots of people mentioning how much
they miss this stuff, etc. People who ran one line or two line BBSs in the old
days two or three or four years ago. Looks like this is going to be very
popular once the word gets out....

half, and still cruising strong]

<P> For a quick link, check out <A HREF=http://bbs.ufies.org/>bbs.ufies.org</A>.

You have to have a telnet client to actually log onto the BBS at

mind bogling....

These are my personal experiences with Linux - and how easy/hard it is

<P> If I compare Linux to OS/2 or Windows, it's much more command-based.
This can make it a bit harder to use in the beginning.

So my conclusion is that you'll have to have some patience when learning
Linux. I have heard that Caldera should be the easiest Linux
distribution to install (I'm using SuSE so I haven't tried it myself.

<P> However, I think that when more and more "normal" (i e non-technical
people) start using Linux we'll see a shift towards a more user-friendly

<P> Good day.

<P> One thing I know that's been a bit of a barrier to people moving to
Linux are applications that they're using written in a Microsoft
development package and threfore, of course, using all Windows-relevant
functions, calls, etc. If Linux is to move off the server and on to the
desktop, in my opinion, functional development apps that can start with
Microsoft based code, translate it to an XWindows GUI,
and then run the programs under Linux. A tall order, I admit, but
necessary to move the small ISV's and the people who use their programs
over to the Linux camp. Otherwise it's going to be stuck like OS/2 was -
sometimes the same software, but versions that were always feature-poor
compared to their Win 'cousins.'

<BR>Subject: Kickstart Examples

<P>Mark,<BR>
two aside comments to your article "Mark's Kickstart Examples"
from issue 43 of Linux Gazette.

<P> You write:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	It would be nice if someone were to help make it so you can create a
	script which would automate the commands for fdisk. Perhaps there is
	and I just don't know about it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> There is really no need for that as for years there exists 'sfdisk'
(probably short for "scriptable fdisk" :-). It is a part of util-linux
package although Red Hat apparently only recently started to include
binaries in their rpm archives.  Sources were there "for always".

<P> It has somewhat spartan user interface, although in some situations is
very capable and I used it interactively without any problems.  It is
also very simple to script, to embed that into "disk cloning" scripts,
and unbeatable in that.  Its documentation includes examples of such
usage.  I have seen once in Linux Journal somebody bragging that they
fed fdisk commands from stdin (doable but scary :-) to automate mass disk
partitioning and I was always scratching my head why they work so hard.
A reluctance to peek into docs, I guess.

<P> I have no idea how to shoehorn that into kickstart operations
without modifying the installation program itself.  The later is
always possible as Red Hat supplies all sources for installation
utilities on their CDs.

<P> I also have an impression that your Perl script at the bottom
of the article tries hard, but not entirely correct, to emulate
the following command:
<PRE>
rpm --queryformat '%{NAME}\n' -qp /home/ftp/RedHat60/RedHat/RPMS/*.rpm
</PRE>

<P> Beside this list which you are after is basically ready in
RedHat/base/comps on CD.

<P> If you wonder what tags you can use in a format try to type
'rpm --querytags'; even 'rpm --help' says so. :-)
