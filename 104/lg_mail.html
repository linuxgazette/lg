Does anybody get this at all on their 2.6 Linux systems? I get it all the time and have just dismissed it, but now I'm curious if anyone has bothered to figure out why it happens.
</P>
<P>
Also, I've just got ahold of a Gmail account, but I haven't been able to decide what to do with it. Does anyone else have a similar dilemma?

<P>
Good afternoon,
My question is...
</P>
<P>
I setup an Internet server with debian the lastest version, I also configure a
squid proxy 2.4 estable6 with squidGuard as redirector, a dhcp, a dns, and
ipchains.
</P>
<P>
The configuration looks like:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>            190.0.0.3
Workstation|---------|--|
                        |    eth0   --------------    eth1       -----

                                      ---------------   Internet   |
                                      | Mail Server |--------------|
                                      ---------------
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
What I am expecting - Run send/recive email messages in what ever email client
in a workstation within my lan and get the email from the external server or
send email with the external server.
</P>
<P>
What is happening - Run send/recieve email messages in Outlook with the right
configuration and it sends a "Conection Refused by the Server" or "Conection
Timeout".I understand that maybe what I am looking for is a pop3 and smtp poxy
server, nevertheless I install pop3.proxy and smtp.porxy servers in my linux
box an it does not retrieve or send the email from workstation to the external
server. I configure fetchmail too an it work but within the server, if I try to
get email from a workstation it crash.
</P>
<P>
What I already did -
</P>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>I already run tcpdump in the eth where the internet conection is (In my case
eth1). In this point I want to mention that in the output of tcpdump I never
saw the header for the retrive of the email message from the
client(Workstation) to the server, nevertheless the conection to Internet is
working fine.


<LI>I also stop my firewall because may be a misconfiguration of the firewall can
block my email, but even without firewall, it crash.


<LI>I installed a pop3 and smtp proxies, and get them run as an inetd service,
but without sucess. I mean the proxy run but can retrieve email from
workstation.


<LI>Finally I had this configuration working with SuSE the problem is that I do
not know exactly how I did it.
</ol></blockQuote>
<P>
At this point I hope some one of you can help me or tell me what I am doing
wrong. Or tell me whatever documentation where I can get an answer.
</P>
<P>
Regards

<P><STRONG>
Hi there,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've just finished reading some of the June issue, I got the feeling that
you are all a little dejected - don't be! You all produce a fantastic read,
absolutely superb - much better than that other one (I did write and tell
them they were crap, but they didn't reply funnily enough).
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Thanks, Steve. I don't know that I'd call it dejection - it's more of a
realization of a lot of work ahead, at least for me. Given that I enjoy
it, though, that's no bad thing.
 -- Ben</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I used to use an Amiga (still own it sans powerpack) and I spent hours and
hours learing to program in C (very very simple stuff), shell scripts and
the like. I loved the learning process and the usability of it all. I was
forced into buying a PC (following the demise of the power pack) and it came
complete with Win95, what a nightmare -I couldn't find out how any of it
worked without paying for the information one way or another. Then I came
across Mandrake 8, actually I was desperately looking for something other
than Windows, and my little world changed. All the information I could ever
want and then some.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
One of my earliest discoveries was your good selves. My favourite Amiga mag
was Amiga Shopper - a good mix of basic newbie stuff and more advanced
information - programming, how the machine works and so on. It pandered to
my newbie needs and as I grew in knowledge so I gained even more from the
magazine.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Your magazine offers something similar, a good mix without pandering too
much to the total newbie. So many magazines seem to offer a three monthly
cycle of tutorials with little new material.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">I was actually considering recycling a bit of our previous material. Jim
Dennis' "Routing 101" is an evergreen that can definitely stand to be
exposed to new minds; my own Perl and shell tutorials (it turns out that
somehow one of the articles I wrote for it never got published!), too.
Yes, people can find them in the old issues - but I suspect that many of
our readers don't go trolling through the archives but just read us once
a month.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">(If anyone's got suggestions on a previous article that's worth dusting
off, my mailbox is always open.)
 -- Ben</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
The only thing I'd like to see is how to build/design a program in for
Linux, don't care what language, just how to design, program and test it, to
give a good correct program.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">[grin] See those very tutorials that I've mentioned. I suggest starting
with shell scripting and climbing up from there.
 -- Ben</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
My Amiga programs were very simple, single user
affairs, and I really don't get OOP and multi user stuff yet. I mean how do
you prevent buffer over-runs and memory loss for example.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Those aren't an issue in the modern scripting languages (shell, Perl,
Python, etc.) In C, well, see my response to Tom. Unless you really know
what you're doing, C can be very dangerous indeed.
 -- Ben</font></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Tom Brown] 
Tip: If you want to learn how to program in OOP, spend a little
time learning Borland's Delphi (it uses a Pascal variant). It has
nearly all the power of C++, and is easier to use than Visual Basic.
Once you get all the C++ syntax out of the way, you'll learn OOP in no
time. Then you can move on to something like C++, Java, or C#. I had
the same trouble you did, and that's what worked for me.

In the meantime, I shall continue to enjoy your magazine.
</STRONG></P>

Some other thoughts:
Get more people to link to you and advertise your site more, most people
would do it out of gratitude for all the good work you guys do.

Find every occurence of the .com one and get a link to your site on there as

Hi Ben,
thank you for the reply.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'll keep an eye out for those tutorials. I've got the O'Reilly Learning
Perl Book and I'm still getting over the stage of "it looks like garbage",
familiarity will sort all of that out no doubt. I seem to recall your
one-liner articles, I found those fascinating as they demonstrated the
problem solving methods you use, and gave a good insight in how to use
what's already there.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Actually, I was talking about my 5-part "Learning Perl" series. Take a
look at <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/authors/okopnik.html"

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Aahh, I'd forgotten about these gems, thank you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm glad to see that buffer overruns etc. are not a problem in Perl or
Python, I'll just avoid C, I'm most familiar with it as a language but it's
some time since I actually used it. Thanks for the example program, I'm
looking forward to looking at that and trying to work out why it isn't
correct.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
As Thomas has already noted (something I originally missed due to being
tired and mostly asleep), it's a buffer overflow due to strncpy not
terminating the string - a truly idiotic design decision. From libc's
info:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre> - Function: char * strncpy (char *restrict TO, const char *restrict
          FROM, size_t SIZE)
     This function is similar to `strcpy' but always copies exactly
     SIZE characters into TO.

     If the length of FROM is more than SIZE, then `strncpy' copies
     just the first SIZE characters.  Note that in this case there is
     no null terminator written into TO.
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>no null terminator</EM> oh my.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At that point, as they say, the rest^H^H^H^Hsystem is history...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Nope, I would never have got this, I'll still run the example to see what
happens 'first hand' though.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Hello Linux Gazette and Editor;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Hi, Rudy -
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I hope that this is the correct mailbox for my "old" question.
About last december i noticed that "www.linuxgazette.com" changed
it pages drasticaly, to the bad. Through a longer search, i found
"linuxgazette.net" (the "old version").
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What happend?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was reading backissues of both versions trying to find some
answers --&gt; no much succes!
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
The answer can be found in the cover article that I wrote when we separated
from SSC (the hosts of LG.com) - take a look at
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue96/reborn.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue96/reborn.html</A> . We've actually been trying
to contact readers like yourself, trying to get the word out that the
original Gazette and the original mission are still very much in operation
and going full force; unfortunately, we have not had much success,
particularly since SSC has acted very hostile indeed throughout the entire
process and has supressed any mention of us in their pages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We still have a large number of readers, mirrors, and translators, but I
wish there was a way to notify people like yourself of the change. If you
have any ideas on that score, please feel free to let me know.

Hello Ben (and the others)!

<P><STRONG>
Thanks for your mail,
"das hat mich wirklich gefreut"
(sorry but I don't know how to translate this one to english,
maybe Karl Heinz can help?)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
According to <A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.com"
	>http://babelfish.altavista.com</A> it translates as "that
really made me happy" - which is a very pleasant sentiment indeed. Thank
you!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
That's the literal translation, and it works fine.  More colloquially
one might say, "It's a pleasure to hear from you."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As far as I know, wirklich means 'really' in the sense of 'truly'
(not falsely), or perhaps 'indeed'.  But in sentances like the one above,
'rally' means 'very much'.  It comes out to the same thing, but does it
in a different way. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'gefreut' also has a sense of rejoicing and perhaps relief.  So it's
more than just 'happy' as in "You gave me a flower and I was happy".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Haven't heard of you and the gang for a long time either.

<P><STRONG>
I was a little bit confused when (over a year ago, as far as I can remember)
I got a mail from (hmm, forgot his name)
claiming he was the editor of the LinuxGazette,
and that he was breaking up with TAG (or something)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Then I stop receiving mails from TAG,
so I thought the Project was dead.

That would have been Phil Hughes. We broke away from SSC - I wrote a
nice little blurb about it here:

</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The old TAG list got shut down shortly after that; Phil wanted to
convert the whole site to CMS, which in my opinion would have killed LG
(and for his "version", it obviously has.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your experience, interestingly enough, represents my exact viewpoint of
what's happened with many of our readers: those who did not catch news
of the changeover - and if you, a member of TAG, missed it, what does
that say about the average reader? - simply decided that the old LG was
no more. One of the things I'd <EM>really</EM> like to do is somehow get
through to those readers wherever possible, and in general get the word
out that the Linux Gazette <EM>is</EM> alive, <EM>is</EM> publishing, and is better
than ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Since then a lot has changed in my live,
At the time of the TAG breakup I was without work,
shortly afterwards I got a job offer at the Metro Group (one of the worlds largest trading companies)
<P>
I landet in a Team of 3 people doing Java/Oracle based
Enterprise Portal and Backend Development,
very interseting stuff, but a <EM>lot</EM> of new stuff to learn.
</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
[grin] In my opinion, that's how any job should be. If there's not a lot
to learn, you're not moving forward. Nobody said that was <EM>easy</EM> - but
then nothing worthwhile in life is.

Right now, I'm actually looking for

and I'm a fussy babysitter. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

- making LG a bit more professional to involve the corporate crowd and
advertising in other Linux-related media, as well as a number of other
specific things to do - sound really good to me; however, I'm still open
to input.

Jimmy:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
I read your article on extensions for Mozilla. Thanks for highlighting
some! I get more and more impressed with what you can do with Mozilla /
FireFox.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
I noticed you wondered this at one point:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
PopupAlt
Popup ALT does exactly what is says on the tin: it provides a popup of
an image's ALT tag when the mouse is placed over it. This feature, which
was present in Netscape 4, was removed from Mozilla for some unknown
reason.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
I believe it was taken out since the correct HTML spec says the alt tag
is only to be displayed if the browser can not display images. It is not
supposed to be a "pop up" info. I couldn't find it, but I think there is
some tag to display a pop up when the mouse hovers.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</strong>
[Ashwin N.] 
The "title" attribute in the "img" tag is shown as popup text by most
browsers when the mouse cursor is hovered over the image.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;img src="your_image.jpeg" title="This should show up when you hover your
mouse over this"&gt;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Anyways, it is a cool extension to show the information, but Mozilla as
default is now more correctly rendering the page. In fact, the W3 says
that the alt tag should be used very carefully, and I've seen some
really long alt tags - this causes problems if your browser translates
to voice or braille, which is the purpose for the alt tag.
See: <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#alternate-text"

Hi folks,
</P>
<P>
you've asked for it, you'll get it: A few thoughts of my own about
missing mail to TAG.
</P>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>The "average" PC user today differs from the average PC user three or
five years ago. Today there are a lot of more people using computers at
work or at home. The majority of these peoples are interested in doing
stuff like writing mails and letters, surfin' the web and other
non-sophisticated stuff like this. Most of them feel no need to find
out why things work for them and how they could could customize or
improve something.


<LI>There are a lot of distributions around, which install with a few
mouse clicks a usable system. There is no need to think (and ask) about
partitions, filesystems, configuration and so on. In most cases there is
no need to edit files e.g under '/etc/ppp/' - it's all done by
${install-tool} with drop-down- and dialog-boxes.


<LI>Linux is grown up -- there are lots of information around (at? on? I
dunno) the internet. Best of it: They are only one "google" away.
</ol></blockQuote>
<P>
I appreciate the project "Linux Gazette" (hey, there are all issues from
the beginning on my workstation's <EM>and</EM> my laptop's hard disks). But: I
feel, nowadays Linux Gazette shouldn't focus on basic- and
newbie-support, but should do more stuff one ore two steps further.
</P>
<P>
BTW: The link on my site points to your (true[tm]) Linux Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Keep on rollin ...

<P>
Nice Regards

<P><STRONG>
I am a little bit concerned the people here (especially those that are
more established) don't fully understand what constitutes a 2c-tip. A
2c-tip is just that -- something that is short and easy and can be done
in a few steps. Asking whether it is appropriate (Neil!) just causes us
more grief to wade through meta questions!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This might be in the form of a configuration tweak, or a minuture
program that performs a given task, etc. Often though, larger tips are
turned into TAG column entries -- and vice versa.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Often what would be flagged by Heather and I as a TAG entry might well
form off-shoots to 2c-tips if the quality of the thread in question is
not worthy.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But we will publish anything not only explicitly marked as a 2c-tip, but
also what we deem appropriate to be one. We certainly don't filter out
sent in tips -- only vary rarely. The only thing I will say to you is
that don't always expect to submit one and see it in the preceeding
release of LG. Heather and I decide which tips get published when.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[jra] 
If you can figure out how to publish tips in an issue of LG that's
already gone out, my hat's off to you, Thomas.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
The method is covered in Jim's "Retro" series. It's based on that
capability of Linux that Linus talked about, executing an infinite loop
in three seconds...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jason Creighton] 
Yes, it's quite a clever method. Instead of going to all the work of
updating every copy of the LG everywhere, we just insert the tips in the
past before all the mirrors pick up the issue.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The one problem is that executing an infinite loop in three seconds can
only place information in the future. In order to place it in the past,
we must use a Windows box, which, as everyone knows, takes an infinite
amount of time to execute a three second loop.

Send them in.... you know you want to.
