<P> A federal judge has indicated that he may rule in favor of <STRONG>Sun
Microsystems</STRONG> in the company's <STRONG>copyright battle with Microsoft
</STRONG>, allowing Sun to keep control of its Java programming language.  The
ongoing legal battle between Sun and Microsoft arose from concerns that
Microsoft violated its licensing agreement with Sun for use of Java's source
code by altering Java to run more effectively on the Windows operating system.
U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte wrote that he will most likely rule in favor
of Sun, preventing Microsoft and other companies from changing Java to run
certain software products better than others.  Some analysts speculate that the
court loss may not deter Microsoft, but will instead provide the company with
incentive to stop using Java or even to develop an alternative.  (Los Angeles
Times 05/26/99)

<P> <STRONG>IBM plans to adjust its AIX operating system to support Linux
applications.</STRONG>  This will allow IBM customers to store all of their Web
applications on one server, the company says.  IBM's Robert LeBlanc says, "As
more customers move to the Web, they'll need to integrate applications."
Enabling AIX to run Linux will help customers simplify and manage growing
networks, says LeBlanc.  IBM's modified version of AIX will be released by the
end of this year, the company says.  Analysts say IBM and Sun, which modified
Solaris to support Linux, are ensuring that they will be able to take advantage
of any Linux Web applications that may become popular in the future.  In
addition to the AIX changes, IBM plans to ship its DB2 software with Pacific
HiTech's TurboLinux version of Linux.  Pacific HiTech will package IBM's
WebSphere software with TurboLinux by the end of 1999, says IBM's Dick
Sullivan.  (Bloomberg 05/25/99)

other Linux projects, putting together a respected certification program 
requires a substantial investment," said Chuck Mead, LPI Director of 
Corporate Relations. "The financial support of the Linux community is 
crucial to our program's timeliness and credibility."

seeks to further develop ties with telecoms, ISP's and distribution
channels for its range of products and services.  IGEL products will
also be localized, for which a local development team will be set up, to
specifically target markets such as China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan;

</font>
</H3> 
<P> Ottawa, Canada -- June 9, 1999 -- <STRONG>Corel</STRONG> Corporation is
pleased to announce that it is joining forces with
<STRONG>Channelware</STRONG>, a business unit of Nortel Networks to rent its
award-winning software applications to customers. This initiative joins the
first program involving distribution of Channelware's NetActive software
through retail stores.

<P> Corel Print House Magic 4 NetActive Version will be available for 
customers to rent at select Blockbuster locations in Austin, Texas, and 
Anchorage, Alaska, starting in June.

"Channelware invented secure Software Activation and we are proud to be 
teaming up with them in this breakthrough initiative," said Dr. Michael 
Cowpland, president and chief executive officer of Corel Corporation. "The 
dynamics of the computer world are changing rapidly, and we are keen to use 
this rental technology to allow our customers to access our products more 
easily - even without leaving their houses. This is an innovation in the 
software industry."

<P> Channelware's NetActive technology will be embedded in the Corel software, 
making it possible for customers to rent the software for 72 hours. Once 
the customer brings the CD-ROM home and launches the application, the 
software will connect to the Channelware Activation Server. A one-time 
InstanceKey is then delivered over the Web in seconds. The key enables the 
customer to start using the software. The NetActive system keeps track of 
how long the customer uses the software, and offers the customer options 
for extended use.


<P> Unlike standard video rentals, the customer will keep the software rental 
CD after the initial rental is over. After the rental period, the user has 
the option to: rent the software again; buy the right to use the rented 
software on a perpetual basis; or buy retail versions of Corel Print House 
Magic online and have the shrinkwrap versions of the product delivered to 
the door. The 72-hour rental has a suggested retail price (SRP) of US 
$5.99; re-renting costs US $3.99. Customers can buy Corel Print House Magic 
4 NetActive Version on a perpetual basis for US $29.95*.

Benchmark specialist invites Red Hat and Microsoft to a rematch

<P> Chicago, IL -(June 17 1999) - Neal Nelson, benchmark guru and founder of
the world's largest independent client/server testing facility, has extended an
invitation to Microsoft and Red Hat to participate in an open, public
performance comparison between hot operating system rivals Windows NT and
Linux.

<P> Nelson issued the invitation as a result of a recently published study
sponsored by Microsoft.* One of the conclusions of the study is that
"Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 is 2.5 times faster than Linux as a File
Server and 3.7 times faster as a Web Server."

<P> Many have questioned the test results because different tuning levels were
used for NT than those used with Linux.  For example, NT was tested with NT
tuning, benchmarking and technical support from Microsoft, as well as
Internet Information Server 4.0 tuning information from the Standard
Performance Evaluation Corp.

<P> Linux however, received almost no additional tuning, support or involvement
from Linux-based technical sources.  The testing lab cited difficulty in
obtaining tuning information from Linux knowledge bases, and a query with
Red Hat ended up going  through the wrong channels.

<P> This has outraged the growing base of Linux supporters who are clamoring for
an unbiased test, one that is not sponsored by either Microsoft or Linux.

<font color="green">Cygnus introduces Code Fusion IDE for Linux
</font>
</H3> 
<P> 
<P> PC EXPO, N.Y., June 21, 1999 - Cygnus Solutions, the leader in
open-source software, today unveiled Cygnus Code Fusion‘ for Linux, the
industry's highest performance1, most complete Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) for Linux developers. Code Fusion IDE makes it
possible for developers familiar with programming on Windows platforms
to quickly become productive in developing for Linux.

<P> The Code Fusion IDE is optimized for the Intel2 Architecture to provide
developers the tools required for building the fastest applications
possible.  This complete Linux IDE tightly integrates C, C++, and Java3
programming languages with a robust graphical user interface (GUI) to
enhance developer productivity and reduce software product
time-to-market.  Cygnus Code Fusion supports all major Linux
distributions to offer Linux developers the most flexibility in
development on and for Linux.  

<P> With Code Fusion, Cygnus combines the latest Cygnus-certified,
open-source GNU tools release with an intuitive graphical IDE
framework.  The performance and functionality of the Code Fusion IDE --
featuring a C, C++, and Java tools project manager, editor, graphical
browsers and the Cygnus Insight‘ debugger interface, is being
demonstrated for the first time at PC Expo in the Linux Pavilion at the
Cygnus Booth, 1525-27.

<P> Cygnus Code Fusion for Linux will be shipped in July 1999 and is priced
at $299. Code Fusion IDE features a simple installation of all necessary
tools to develop software on Linux, including printed and on-line
documentation and 30-day installation support upon registration.  Code
Fusion will be available for purchase online at www.cygnus.com/linux and
through the Cygnus Partner Program.  

<P> Cygnus also announced plans to release the source code to <STRONG> Cygnus
Insight</STRONG>, a graphical user interface (GUI) for the industry-standard
GNU debugger, GDB.  Known in programming circles as GDBtk, the Cygnus Insight
GUI provides the technology for effective and efficient debug sessions by
improving a software developer's ability to visualize, manage, and examine the
status of a program as it is debugged.  The source code for Cygnus Insight
debugger will be available from Cygnus in July on
http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb.
