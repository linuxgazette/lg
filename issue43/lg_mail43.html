<BR>Subject: <FONT COLOR=navy>suggestions and comments</FONT>

<P> Hi. read your "Getting started with Linux" and as it says it gives a brief
introduction to Linux. I've just started with linux, slakware, and comming from
windows there are some problems that are hard to figure out for yourself. First
of all it's this thing with devices. It took me two hours to get my cd-rom to
work. it's simple, but if you don't know how to mount your cd or you don't know
what a mounted hd/cd etc. is then it's quite tricky. And very often you need
your cd. Then it took me about three more hours to connect to internet. This
was also quite tricky comparing to just use the dial-up networking in windows.
Since much information about linux can be found on the internet it's not good
if you can't connect to it. I don't need this information, but I think these
two things are stuff you should put in your article, espescially how to connect
to an internet provider so you can serch for information on the web.  daniel,

<BR>Subject: <FONT COLOR=navy>RedHat Linux 6.0 on a Tecra 8000</FONT>

<P> I recently attempted to install RedHat Linux 6.0 on a Toshiba Tecra 8000
notebook computer, and ran into a couple of problems.  The first time I
installed it, everything appeared to be working properly, except the
keyboard keys were too "touchy".  Many times, it would act like the keys
were sticking and print a character twice when it was pressed once.
(I've seen a couple other references to this issue on Usenet, but no
solutions were posted.)

<P> After I used Linux for several days on the notebook, I encountered a
situation where it didn't unlock the hard drive for read/write usage
after it finished performing a disk check with fsck, and subsequent
reboots failed due to the file system being stuck in "read only" mode.

<P> At this point, I decided to reformat and do another install from
scratch.  This time around, the only changes I made were #1, not to put
the system in runlevel 5 so it started in X immediately upon boot-up,
and #2, enabled the apmd service for advanced power management.  When
this install completed, I had problems right away where Linux would boot
- and then I wouldn't be able to type on the keyboard at all.  (Every so
often, I was able to get control of the keyboard back - but only after
multiple reboots by hitting the power button on the notebook.)

<P> Has anyone else out there had any luck running Linux on a Tecra 8000?
Thanks, Tom.

<BR>Subject: <FONT COLOR=navy>IPChaining and Firewall rules</FONT>

<P>I  have a small home network with 5 systems.  I use Linux as my
proxy/firewall/dial-upon demand internet server and fileserver.
Before I upgraded to RH6 I could go to any site on the Web.  Now with RH6 I
cannot get to some sites.    ie: www.hotmail.com, www.outpost.com and
www.iomega.com to name a few. I can get to them from my Linux box but not
from the network. It sends the request and I see some data return but then
everything stops.

Here is my rc.firewall file:

<PRE>
# In rc.d make a script called rc.firewall. Make it mod 700.
# Makes it read/write/execute by owner(root)
# chmod 700 rc.firewall

#!/bin/sh
#
#rc.firewall - Initial SIMPLE IP Masquerade test for 2.2.3 kernels
#using IPCHAINS
#enable dynamic IP address
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr

/ipchains -M -S 7200 10 60

#
#Home Area Network
#192.168.28.0/24
#
ipchains -P forward DENY
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQ
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.1/24 -j MASQ
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.2/24 -j MASQ
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.4/24 -j MASQ
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.5/24 -j MASQ
</PRE>

<P> It looks like those sites don't like how my proxy/firewall is setup.  This
only happened when I upgraded to RH6 and the 2.2 series of kernels.

<P> Any Ideas?????????

<BR>Subject: <FONT COLOR=navy>NFS boot RH6.0 Alpha?</FONT>

<P> I have a few old Alpha (UDB Multia) systems. All but one have no disks.
I'm hoping to figure out how to NFS boot one of them to become a diskless
firewall box.  I noticed while configuring the kernel that there is an option
for NFS mount of the root, so I suspect all the software pieces are there -
just a small matter of configuring the server to listen for NFS requests. The
primary question I have, is: does anyone know if it is possible (through the
SRM or ARC consoles) to boot directly from the net, or do I have to boot a
floppy first that then boots from the net? I think there's also a way to put
milo into flash memory so I don't need the floppy for milo, but I don't know
how to tell milo to see the ethernet device.  If I can't do it directly, how do
I do it indirectly? - it sure would be nice to have one (or more) diskless
alphas. On a somewhat related topic - is there any problem with adding a PCI
NIC card to the Multia to get a second ethernet device for my firewall effort?
Thanks in advance. /egp

<P> Hi, again.  I've started saving my photos with a KODAK Picture Disk when I

that I'm using Linux there is.  KODAK does not support Linux with the software
that comes with their disks.  When I save my images to my HD using MCOPY, the

turn them 'right-side-up', and have managed to do just about everything else
with those images using gimp *but* that.  (I fully admit I have no knowledge
about image manipulation, and really only want to know enough to accomplish

<BR>Subject: <FONT COLOR=navy>Linux as Xterminal with SGI</FONT>

<P> I'd like to ask about a strange thing I am getting when I run an SGI
application displayed on a Linux Xserver(PC )

<P>The Linux Xserver is running with RedHat 5.2 as following:
<PRE>
  Driver      "accel"
    Device      "Trio32/Trio64"
    Monitor     "Standard VGA, 640x480 @ 60 Hz"
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       32
        Modes       "640x480"
        ViewPort    0 0
        Virtual     800 600
</PRE>

<P> If I open a tiff image (RGB 24bits) on the SGI it shows ok with all colors.
It is also OK  if I open the same image on the Linux server using XV or Gimp.

<P> But if I display the image on the linux monitor while it is running on the
SGI the colors are not matching at all.  The image resolution is perfect but
for the colors , the white is getting yellowish as if the green channel is
missing or getting dimmer or I can say as the blue and red channel are swapped.

<P> I used with a csh login on sgi:

<PRE>
setenv DISPLAY linux1:0
fm /var/tmp
</PRE>

<P> On linux  The fm window appears and I doubleclick on a tiff image:
<PRE>Spok.tif</PRE>
a window open with the image of my cat ( white originally) with yellow
dominance.

<P> Today I am asking myself what is wrong and how should I repair.  Can
anybody help on this.

<P> Thanks in advance

<P> I have been using fvwm95 on RH5.2.  All the xterms have scrollbars on the
left side of their window.  I recently installed SuSE6.1 and found that the

tough to look back through a screen's previous display.  I tried the "Scroll
module" in the fvwm95 configuration menue but it scrolls the window itself
rather than the screen display history.  I know the previous lines are there
because past display lines appear when I resize the window vertically.

exists. So I am back to square one.

<P> I have purchased REDHAT 6.0 at a local Linux fair. Unfortunately I go
not get them to partition and install it on my computer for free as I
was leaving for China the next day. Now I am trying to do so with great

metalab.unc.edu etc does not serve my needs, so I need your expertise in
detail on how to go about it.

<P> I have formatted my HardDisk 4.5GB.<BR>
It has a DOS 6.2 pre-partition of26%<BR>
The Extended partition is 74%<BR>
Logical Drives E: and F: are each 37%<BR>
Drive E: has Win98. F: is for Linux.<BR>
I have a second slave Hard Disk as D:<BR>

<P> Problem arise when I boot REDHAT 6.0, its an auto generated process
which guides me through. First question: SCSI [select: No/Yes?Back].
When selecting Yes, a selection is provided but on choosing and going to
auto verification, all proposals are rejected because my system has an
Adaptec AVA-1502 SCSI Host Adaptor. I can't go any further!

<P> First, I have gone about the right partitioning?

started.

<P> I am currently running redhat 4.2 for SPARC on a SPARC IPC.  I have been
programming C and C++ for about four years now, but this problem has me
stumped.  I am trying to port a few apps over from i386 linux to Sparc
linux.  I downloaded the source files and untarred them just fine, but from
then on the horrors begin.  I have read the docs for each app and followed
the instructions meticulously, and even tried some of my own homebrewed
fixes to try and get the sources to run, but I still can not get anywhere.
The problems seem to lie in not the source itself, but in the libs
installed on my machine.  I get tons of warnings and one error that seems
to stand out.  The error is transcribed as something like this:

<PRE>
/usr/include/time.h:58 -- Parse error for fd_func
</PRE>

<P> The only other problem I have found is on perusal of the *.h files, I have
found numerous references to header files in directories that don't EVEN
EXIST!!!  Is this a standard thing, or just on the SPARC port for linux?
For example, I am looking inside my /usr/include/sys/time.h and find
references to a linux/time.h, when there is not a linux directory
anywhere!!  Is this a standard?  If it is, it seems that someone got a
little sloppy in their porting.  I have managed to fix this problem by
going in and removing references to files that don't exist or redirecting
them to files that do exist, but the error above has definitely stumped me.
 Does anyone have experience with this error and how it can be fixed?  I
don't have much experience in building my own header files, but when I did
do it, I never saw that error.  I would be much obliged to anyone who could
provide some guidence in this issue.

<P>Spett.le Direttoredel  Linux Gazzette,

<P> Mi chiamo Nino Brando, e dato che ho visto in edicola una promozione(se si
può chiamarla così) della red hat di linux, contenente 4 CD.

<P> Vengo al nocciolo, e possibile che ci sia il sistema operativo Linux? Anche
perchè il prezzo non supera le £.25.000, e poi la Red Hat è un sistema
operativo?

<P> Chiedo scusa per la mia ignoranza ma è da poco che vorrei entrare nel mondo
Linux, sarei lieto di una risposta ed anche di qualche consiglio.

<P>La ringrazio,<BR>
distinti saluti<BR>

<BR>Subject: <FONT COLOR=navy>Help! Compatibility problems between linux and windows filesystems;</FONT>
StarOffice 5.1;  Graphics settings

<P> Hi Linuxsters, I am a current Win98 user trying to switch to Linux, but
I have run into a few little problems!

<P> Firstly, after successfully partitioning my HDD and installing Red Hat
Linux 5.2, I wanted to reinstall Win98 as it was getting rather slow.
So I mounted my (FAT32) C: drive in Linux (mount -t vfat /dev/hda1
/mnt/c:) and backed up my essential files onto the Linux partition.

<P> After reinstalling Windows I copied the files back, only to discover
that some seemed to be corrupted by the Linux filesystem.  Some
self-extracting programs like WinZip 7.0 and WinBoost 1.24 will not
execute, giving errors like "Permission denied" or "This is not a Win32
application". This is not a drama as I can simply download these again,
however many of my important compressed "zip" files containing Word
documents are corrupt and some files cannot be extracted.  What is the
sitch?  Can these files be "fixed"?  Should I completely avoid mixing
the two filesystems in future?  Any help would be gratefully
appreciated!

<P> Another problem I had was installing StarOffice 5.1 Personal Edition for
Linux - it freezes on page 2 of setup where it asks for the registration
key number. I downloaded the program from download.com and therefore
don't have a number. Even if I did it would be no use as the program
freezes anyway.  Also I have since realised that it is probably because
I only have 15MB RAM (1MB for built-in video card) and not the minimum
requirement of 32MB (duh!).  Which poses the question, "Why does MS
Office happily run on my system with the flaw-ridden inefficient Windows
OS, while StarOffice won't?"  Please excuse me, I am only new to Linux!
I plan to upgrade my RAM soon so hopefully this won't be a problem -
just curious, you know?

<P> I am also having problems getting the appropriate graphics settings
happening on Linux. I have a Socket 7 M571 motherboard with a built-in
64-bit VGA chip.  It is a 1 to 4MB chip and I have set it to 1MB (in
BIOS) due to my pathetic RAM situation.  In Windows I can easily go to
800x600 and 1024x768 with 16- and 24-bit colour.  During Red Hat Linux
5.2 installation I selected "VGA16" video card and "Custom:
Non-interlaced SVGA; 800x600@60Hz, 640x480@72Hz" monitor type. But it
won't go above 640x480 resolution without going into virtual mode. The
colour settings are also not right.  What do I do?

<P> And finally (!) every time I exit "X", I get an error message "FreeFont
count is 2; should be 1; Fixing..." What does this mean and how do I fix
it? (do I need to?)

<P> I love the idea of leaving Windows behind but I can't while I have these
problems!  Could I ask that any responses be reasonably basic as I am
totally new to Linux (or should I say "Linux is totally new to me!").
All help will be greatly appreciated!  Thank you...

<P> Zubin.

<P> Hi,
<P> I am growing to like the idea, philosophy behind Linux. I am a home user,
reasonable non-technical, is this a good move? and what is the difference
between Redhat and Suse. I hope I'm sending this to the right place and hope
that you'll give me an answer.

<P> Many thanks<BR>

<P> I found a reliable way to crash KFM: look at the front page, follow the link to
the current issue, then follow the front page link. A few people have reported
KFM crashes. I ran Amaya to check the page for errors and found the following:

<PRE>
*** Errors in http://www.linuxgazette.com/ temp file: /home/phma/.amaya/1/www.linuxgazette.com

   line 114, char 7: Tag &lt;table&gt; is not allowed here
</PRE>
[rest of error message not shown.]

<P> Please fix them (I suspect the &lt;/table&lt;, but it might be something
else).

<BR>Subject: <FONT COLOR=navy>Setting up mail for a home network using exim</FONT>

<P> I was just reading the article "Setting up mail for a home network using
exim" in issue 42 and I noticed one possible problem. In the suggested .forward
file any mail that contains Emily in the To header will go to emi's mailbox, if
someone was to send a message with several addresses in the To field one to
jbloggs and one address had Emily in it (weather Emily be the Emily on the
local network or some other Emily).  If a person sent mail with only one To
address and bcc'd or cc'd the rest that problem wouldn't exist but alas not all
email is sent that way (at least to me).  You could probably cut down on the
possibility of this a bit by having it look for Emily's first and last name.

<P>Regards,<BR>
Coran

<BR>Subject: <FONT COLOR=navy>LG Issue 42 - email article</FONT>

<P> I was most impressed with the following article in Linux Gazette 42, 
June 1999: "Setting up mail for a home network using exim"

<P> I followed Jan's suggestions on a RedHat 5.1 Linux system and it 
eventually worked. You may care to note the following comments and 
pass them on to the author (as no email address was offered).

<OL>
	<LI> The "exim" package as supplied with RedHat Linux does not include
"eximconfig". I pinched a copy from a Debian distribution using ar and tar. The
configure file is too hard to setup without it.

	<LI> The perl script "outfilt" as published, fails on my system.  The
'@' character in the script should be '\@'.

	<LI> As I do not use a Smarthost for email, I found that taking out the
reference to it in the ROUTERS CONFIGURATION section of the exim configure
file, worked fine. (Note that Debian uses exim.conf whereas the RedHat version
of exim uses the file 'configure').
</OL>

<P> I have seen many requests for interfacing MS Internet Mail (???) to
Linux mail facilities on the Linux User Group discussion lists and
this article is most timely.

<P> Thank you for a great magazine.<BR>
