<BR>Subject: redhat 6.1 'hdc: lost interrupt' problems

<P> i own a panasonic 24x CDROM, a quatum 2.5GB bigfoot  and recently purchased 
a segate 17.2GB.

<P> i am getting 'hdc: lost interrupt' constanly through the install ( which 
ploads along for about 2 hours ) then ends in what i think is suppoed to be 
text displayed, only the screen then starts displaying out of sync, drawing 
lines across the screen which look like very large ( 2 inch, or 4 centimetre 
) and unreadable  letters.  thus the install ends. ( obviously incomplete )

<P> other probs with computer which may have influeenced

<P> a) to install the seagate was extremly hard requiring about an hours worth 
on fiddling with ide cables and jumper settings, currently the quatum is 
master of the primary ide, with nothing else, the cdrom is secondary master 
and the seagate is secondary slave. this is about the ONLY way all devices 
are detected properly AND the cd is able to boot.

<P> b) -before the segate was installed- i have ( along with other a queer 
'randomly order' file display in windows explorer for only some directories 
) not beenable to play audio cds, with them either not being detected by 
windows 'cdplayer' or jumping from track to track when play is pressed, 
without playing anything.  although data and video cd's continue to run 
fine.

<P> thank you for your time ( and possibly help )

<BR>Subject: Help Wanted: XF86 3.3.6 vs ATi Rage 128

<P> so. i need some help over here. X is not working properly with my spanking new ATi Rage 128-card ("bar code text"). here's what i have done so far:

<P> downloaded XF86 3.3.6 (binary) (which supports ATi Rage 128) to my Win98 disk.
installed a normal installation of Red Hat 6.1 (in text mode) to my linux disk.
installed XF86 3.3.6 properly to my linux disk, taking great care not to overwrite the original `xinitrc' provided by Red Hat
runned XF86Setup, configured everything there;the XF86Setup-test worked nicely
runned `startx', which started Gnome etc.
the Gnome Help Browser popped up, but the text... it was all like bar codes (that is, only horizontal lines). but occasionally, perfectly legible text popped up when scrolling. the words `Gnome Help Browser' in the title line was perfectly legible all the time.
and yes, i have entered the correct sync rates for my monitor. 
i presume this is a font problem, but the means to solve it i cannot begin to comprehend. yea, i have clutched my brain rather avidly trying to get my system working properly. i have even tried deleting the font-folder before installing XF86-3.3.6... and making sure that the font-folder was regenerated when installing XF86-3.3.6. 

<P> so. in summary, the main problem seems to be the weird behaviour of text when using X ("bar code text"). any help to solve this
problem would be greatly appreciated.

<BR>Subject: RE: Clenning(sic) lost+found

<P> I notice Ed said "it's often the sign of serious disk corruption". May I beg
to disagree? Note that ALL of the files in lost+found are of type b or c. I
don't know why or how this corruption occurs, but I found that (1) I
couldn't delete them, and (2) the machine gaily carried on working with no
sign of any problems.

<P> The problem only went away when the computer was scrapped - it was a 386 and
was replaced with a 686MX.

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[It sounds like we agree.  Perhaps I wasn't clear.  Really weird
	permissions like </EM><CODE>"c-wx--S-w-"</CODE><EM> that no sane person
would ever do even in their stupidest moments can be a sign that some hardware
fault has zapped the system.  Data corruption is the result, not the cause.
The goal is then to find the cause or scrap the computer.  Perhaps the cause
was a one-time thing, as apparently happened in your case.

	<P> The files that wouldn't delete may have had their immutable or
undeletable attribute set.  The command </EM><CODE>lsattr</CODE><EM> (see
manpage) shows which attributes a file has, and </EM><CODE>chattr -i
-u</CODE><EM> will remove those attributes.  Attributes are like permissions
but refer to additional characteristics of files in the ext2 filesystem.
However, </EM><CODE>lsattr /dev</CODE><EM> spews out a whole lot of error
messages, so it may be that the command won't help with device files ("b" or
"c" as the first character of a </EM><CODE>ls -l</CODE><EM> entry.) -Ed.

<BR>Subject: 

<P> I would really like to see case studies on switching to Linux form other
platforms.

<P> Here's our platform and some requirements and questions:

<P> We currently use Windows NT Terminal Server Edition. How hard would it be to
go to Linux?

<P> - We have two TSE servers with approximately 30 users each logged in on
average. In total, we have about 130 users but it is a manufacturing plant
and many people share terminals.

<P> - We use Citrix Metaframe, for Load Balancing and failover. Is there a
product for Linux that offers this option?

<P> - We use thin clients (Boundless (www.boundless.com) Windows CE terminals
with RDP and ICA protocols) and no X.  I have not been happy with the CE
terminals.  I was wondering if an X-term performed better?  You can really
see how slow CE is if you just click on the start button and move the mouse
up and down the program list.  I had an old PC with not enough RAM and the
ICA client worked much better than the CE ICA client.  I just found
www.ltsp.org and the x-terms look fantastic (you could do a whole article
just on that project).

<P> - Dependability. I have to reboot my TSE servers once a week.  Last week a
new HP printer driver caused about 40 blue screens of death before we
figured out what was going on.  Will Linux be better?

<P> - Office productivity software.  If we are used to MS Office, what will it
be like going to something like star-office?

<P> - Anti-virus programs?  Is there an antivirus program to scan mail stores
(sendmail POP server)?

<P> - Security.  How good is Linux at keeping users honest?  With TSE you can
delete or overwrite files in the system directories as a user.  Can't delete
a system file? Just open it in Word and save it and watch us IS guys jump
around.

<P> Hi,

<P> I'm new to the Linux Gazette but not new to Linux, and I've had a hell
of a time trying to find clear, step-by-step info about how to
WRITE Japanese under RedHat Linux 6.1.  Part of the problem is that I
don't READ Japanese well enough to sift through the Japanese sites, but
I've found a program called "dp/NOTE" from OMRONSOFT which almost
works--apparently, the program is supported by the Japanese version of
RedHat 6.1, but I don't know what RPMs to download to get the thing to
run under the English version...or even if it will run at all.  Are
there fundamental differences between the Japanese and the English
versions?  Should I set up a dual boot system?  Ideally, I'd like to
just run English RedHat but have a program I can pull up that will allow
easy romaji text input and then convert to hiragana, katakana, or
Kanji.  There's a nice program by NJStar that does that, but it's
(barf!) Windoze95 only.

<P> Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.

<BR>Subject: Help with group rights and Netscape Composer

<P> I've search deja news, Linux HowTos, and books, and
I have not seen this error mentioned.  Makes me think
it something on my end, but I can't figure out what
it is.  I'm hoping someone can help.

<P> I am running RedHat Linux 5.2 and Netscape 4.08.

<P> I created a group called web and made a directory 
<PRE>
/usr/local/webauth
</PRE>

<P> I set the group and the SGID bit on that directory
<PRE>
chgrp -v web /usr/local/webauth
chmod -v 2775 /usr/local/webauth
</PRE>

<P> Now for the problem:

<P> Anyone in the web group should be able to save into
that directory.  With Netscape composer they can only
edit files that already are in that directory!?!

<P> If I use the "Save As" option in Netscape Composer to
save into that directory I get the following error:

<P> "The file is marked read-only."

<P> The same error occurs using the "Save" option to save
a new file to that directory.  BUT, if I open a file
from that directory in netscape, edit it, and use the 
"Save" option, it will write over the old file in that 
directory.  I can edit any existing html files created 
by anyone in the "web" group.

<P> What on earth is going on?  The users belong to the web
group and they can all create files in /usr/local/webauth 
via the touch command or emacs.  The users all have a 
umask of 002. The files they create with touch or emacs 
are all are created 
<PRE>
-rw-rw-r-- username.web filename
</PRE>

<P> They can use emacs to open end edit each others files in
/usr/local/webauth, but they can't create new files with
netscape composer!  They can only edit existing files and
save them to the same filename.

<P> The only way I can get "Save As" and "Save" to create new
files in /usr/local/webauth is to set the permissions to
<PRE>
chmod -v 2776 /usr/local/webauth 
</PRE>
or 
<PRE>
chmod -v 2777 /usr/local/webauth
</PRE>
which defeats the whole point of creating special work 
groups and protecting the files from being written by 
anyone not in the group.


<P> If you can, please shed some light on this. 
Thank you.

<P> Hello!

<P> I am proud to announce this: "I'm a 4 day Linux admin, and i'm doing "fine" :) "

<P> OK. Now to the important problems:

<P> 1. I've found that in the Net3-4 HOWTO :
"If you are interested in using Linux for ISP purposes the I recommend
  you take a look at the Linux ISP homepage for a good list of pointers
  to information you might need and use."
in Net3- HOWTO I found this :
"11.  Linux for an ISP ?

<P>   If you are interested in using Linux for ISP purposes the I recommend
  you take a look at the Linux ISP homepage
  <http://www.anime.net/linuxisp/> for a good list of pointers to
  information you might need and use."
  but the link is broken...
  Q: What now? (I am interested in making linux for ISP purposes)
2. A Winmodem solution for Linux users.
   If U are luky to have an win9x sistem connected to the linuxbox trought an network card, then do this:
   -  install a Wingate like SyGate 2.0 for Win on the Win9x box
   -  In Linux make Default Gateway to link to the Win9x box IP
  That's all for the moment :)

<P> TNX
 bye.

<P> [What's "aim"?  Is it a Linux program?  We publish only questions
dealing with Linux-related issues.  Also, are these "errors" things
which crash the browser or are you simply trying to prevent the

reason for doing so?

<P> If you really have a program with a bug in it, we need to know what the
program is, who makes it, whether it's standalone or runs with a web

you get, and what kind of computer and version of Linux you have. -Ed.]

<BR>Subject: Sendmail faster start up!

<P> Hi,

<P> I am having trouble with sendmail. I read an article in the Gazette dated
a few? months? ago about setting up sendmail, but I'm still puzzled.

<P> I am running MkLinux R1 (a RedHat 6.0 implementation) and sendmail takes
forever to startup. Taking a cue from the article, I stopped the
sendmail daemon, started up pppd, and then restarted sendmail. It
started up much faster. Also I've noticed that if I don't have the pppd
up,sendmail tries to ping my other computer (the two are connected by an
ethernet and router). Both machines are at home. The other machine does

on boot, what can I do to make sendmail start up faster?

<P> It should be included in your distribution.  I know only Debian, so
when I type "dpkg -S fsck" it shows me fsck and fsck.ext2 are in the
"e2fsprogs" package.  (There are other fsck modules for different
filesystem types in other packages, including "util-linux".)  Rpm (and
yast?) do a similar thing but with different command-line options.
Find the appropriate command on your system and it will show which
package the program comes from.  Probably e2fsprogs*.srpm or
util-linux*.srpm or a similar file will have the source you want.

<BR>Subject: Pine and Pico not "open source"?

<P> I just got around to reading the February edition of Linux
Gazette.  I was more than a little perplexed by the claim
in the article about nano that pico and pine weren't "open
source".

<P> While it's true that pine and pico aren't under the GPL,
neither are many other open source stalwarts like sendmail
and apache.  Even a quick read of the license 
<A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/pine/overview/legal.html">
http://www.washington.edu/pine/overview/legal.html</A>

<P> makes it clear that the source can be used for any use,
even commercial, that it can be modified, and that it can
be distributed.  I certainly don't see anything that
would prevent it from being considered open source.

<P> Oh, and the source is available, of course.  Always has
been.

<P> And, although you can't get the pico source separately from
the entire source tree, you can build just pico or, if
your OS is one of the supported ones, download a pico
binary for your systems from the unix-bin directory.

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin/">
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin/</A>


<P> Not that nano isn't a perfectly good editor and effort.  There
can't be too many.  But keep the facts about pine and pico
straight.

<H4> Scott Morizot &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tmorizot@adc.is.irs.gov">tmorizot@adc.is.irs.gov</A>&gt; wrote</H4>

<P> Ummm.  GPL'ed software is protected under copyright also.  So is
sendmail.  So is apache.  All of those licenses are licenses to use
copyrighted software.  UW's is just another license to use copyrighted
software.  But all free software protected by a license is copyrighted
software and includes some sort of restrictions on its use.  GPL software
is no less under copyright than software under any other license.
In fact, copyright is what allows the GPL to make the restrictions on
use that it does.  Software that is not under copyright is in the public
domain and absolutely no restrictions may be made on its use at all.

<P> I didn't see anything in the legal notice that would constrain the 
redistribution of binary versions of pico.  And, in fact, binary versions 
of pico are redistributed with most distributions of Linux.  

<P> While it's not GPL, I still fail to see any terms in the UW pine license
that cause it not to meet the open source definition.

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
[The license does not allow you to distribute modified binaries of
pine.  (Hint: all the Packages in your Linux distribution are "modified
binaries", because they undergo customization to adhere to the distribution's
overall standards.)  This is why it's not "open source".  Pine is not 
included in Debian.  Instead, you install special packages which include
the source and diffs and compile it yourself.  -Ed.

<P> Some time ago you had trouble with your mailinglist (lg-announce). Your
latest announcement was received twice, I therefore attach a text file with the
headers from the two messages. I hope this will help you to fix the problem.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>
	[The latest round of duplicates was caused by the same problem as
	the ones last fall--a certain subscriber or their ISP had a
	misconfigured mail program which sent the message back to
	the list.  This address was in the middle of the Received: lines
	of all the duplicate message samples we saw.
	
	<P> There are some mailers (Windoze?) which do not honor the
	envelope-to field of forwarded mail as they should, but instead think
	they should send it to everybody in the To: header--even though this
	has already been done.  And majordomo's code to detect this sort of loop
	appears to be broken.  While we work on a solution at the software
	level, we have unsubscribed that address and complained to the user and
	his/her postmaster.

<BR>Subject: Microsoft OS's, their pricing and Linux

<P> Greetings,

<P> Perhaps someone has brought this up before, but I have YAMSCT (Yet another
Microsoft conspiracy theory :).  Maybe this whole thing about them not
being able to combine the NT kernel with the Win9x series of OS's is a
ruse.  

<P> If they did that, based on the current anti-trust scrutiny, they'd
have to lower the price of WinNT/2000/whatever to the price of Win98/ME.
They'd never be allowed to force home users to pay the premium price that
businesses are now paying for Win2KPro on the desktop.

<P> So as long as they have 2 separate product lines, they can charge
basically double for Win2000 that gets sold to businesses.  They would
completely lose those higher profit margins if they merged the products.

<P> I know I'm preaching to the proverbial choir, here, but it will take Linux
to end this.  But only when you can have it *all* (I'm typing this from a
telnet session to my Debian box from Win98SE, since I want to use all the
features of RealPlayer 7, java, Diablo and Descent 3).  I'm hopeful that
Mozilla will cure the java problems under Netscpape (does anyone know if
this will be the case?), more games are coming out for Linux all the
time, but what about multimedia apps?  Is there Free project out there to
fill this gap?  I haven't heard anything about Real releasing a fully
functional RealPlayer for Linux, especially as a plug-in.

<P> As much as it pains me to say it, right now I'm afraid Linux *is* lacking
on the desktop. Here I am, a Linux evangelist (practically a zealot, ask
my friends) and I spend more time in Win98 than I do Linux because of the
games and internet apps available.

<P> What can we do about this?  Is it enough to send emails to companies like
Real to get them to release the same software for Linux that they do for
Windows?  We certainly can't expect MS to release Media Player 6.4 (which
*is* an excellent app, btw) for Linux.

<P> Stephen:

<P> In your C|Net article on Corel's release of Photo-Paint for Linux, 
(<A HREF="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1569948.html">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1569948.html</A>)
you mentioned Gimp and Adobe as Corel's most likely competitors.  This isn't 
exactly true.  First, Gimp has no marketing or business structure.  Not even a
non-profit.  So, although its a terrific program, it lacks the exposure
that a commercial application can get.  In the long run, this may hurt it.

<P> (I actually toyed with the idea of trying to form a non-profit or even a
for-profit to keep Gimp a strong product, but coming up with a business
model for this type of application is difficult.  Its not likely selling the
OS, where service and support can bring in significant income.)

<P> Adobe's move into Linux is limited, so far, to its PDF and word processing
tools.  Its not, as far as I know, doing anything about porting is graphics or 
layout applications (though Frame is probably considered a layout too by
many).  Corel's not really competing with Adobe in graphics on Linux yet.

<P>  <A HREF="http://www.mediascape.com">Mediascape</A> is about ready to
launch its vector based ArtStream for Linux next month.  This will be the first
entry into the Linux layout tools market.  Not long after that, Deneba
(www.denebe.com) is expected to launch their Linux version of Canvas 7, a
popular Mac image editing tool with vector, layout, and Web development
features.  These would be Corel's main competitors in the vector graphics
arena.  Gimp remains a competitor in the raster-based image editing front, but
the lack of prepress support and and organizational structure could eventually
become a problem.
