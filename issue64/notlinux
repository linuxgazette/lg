If only !

Imagine how wealthy you would be now if you owned a chunk of a company like Yahoo 
or Hotmail. You would be loaded.

However, if someone had contacted you a few years ago and offered you the opportunity 
to own a slice of one of these companies…what would you have done?

I will tell you. You would have ignored the chance because you would have considered 
it a get rich quick scheme and relegated the proposal to the trashcan.

Well, in January a brand new online community (Going Platinum) is being launched 
and it is generally felt, by people who know about these things, that it is going 
to be as big, if not bigger, than the companies I have mentioned.

I am offering you a chance to be part of this Company for FREE!
True…there is an opportunity to invest $25, if you want to increase your earning 
power, but that choice is purely optional.

Now you have two choices:

a)	Visit http://www.goingplatinum.com/member/mikeblizard now!
You could sign up for free, read the material, and decide if you would like to 
invest $25 in your future.
      
b)	You could condemn this message to the waste bin. If you decide to do this, 
                     
Remember - in a few years time when Going Platinum is really big – you had the 
opportunity to be on board for no cost and you just couldn't be bothered.

Mike Blizard

This IPO company is reserving a portion of the shares offered for sale to individual investors and will not sell these shares to institutional investors.  Shares will be sold on a first come first serve basis; you will not be bumped for a large investor!  It is anticipated that the offering will close within the next 30 days.  Any Subscription Agreement received after the deadline will be promptly returned.  You need not purchase through a stockbroker and there are no commissions to be paid.  Only a few investors have been chosen to invest in the IPO of a revolutionary company that may change the way real estate is sold.

GC Funding, Inc and its subsidiary Buycor, Inc. provide home sellers with a guaranteed purchase contract to buy their home for 97% of the appraised value.  Best of all, sellers can still market their home for sale and if a better offer is presented, accept it and cancel GC Funding's purchase contract.  It is like having a backup offer or safety net to use only if needed.  This product gives sellers the peace of mind and confidence to make an offer to purchase their next home without first selling their existing home or incurring expensive bridge financing.  GC Funding sells its Guaranteed Purchase product with traditional relocation services such as: finding realtors, securing mortgages, contracting with moving companies and coordinating the move.  Customers deal with a single experienced person who facilitates and coordinates the relocation.  These services are currently available for free to home sellers.  Realtors, Builders and employers are paying the cost of the guaranteed purchase service.  Wouldn't you agree that these services will be in even greater demand in a stagnant or recessionary economy?

Be part of the next wave in real estate.  We're offering you the opportunity to buy stock in this revolutionary venture.  To find out more about the company, please visit our web site at www.buycor.com then click on the tab "Offering Circular" or call the company toll free at 1-877-4buycor (1-877-422-3267) and ask for Richard Talley.

To take advantage of this IPO opportunity, investors will need to complete the Subscription Agreement located on the last page of the offering circular or located separately on our web site under the tab "Offering Circular".  Just complete the investor information and then click on the link "Subscription Agreement" and print it.  Complete the printed Subscription and return via regular mail or overnight carrier to GC Funding, Inc., 5808 S. Rapp Street, Suite 235, Littleton, CO  80120 along with an investment check made payable to GC FUNDING, INC., Special Escrow Account prior to the closing of the offering.  

This is not a solicitation to purchase stock and is only available to residence of certain states.  The offering is limited and can only be considered by investors who have carefully read the offering circular and understand the investment risks.
