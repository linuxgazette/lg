Hi guys and thanks in advance fro your time. I'm Joe From Toronto.

I have this scenario at home.

<P><STRONG>
I would like to use the linux machine as a router for the internal PC&gt;
Could you help me with that, please???

OK, I'll give it a shot. You <EM>have</EM> read and followed the advice in the
IP-Masquerade HOWTO, right? If not, it's always available at the Linux
Documentation Project &lt;<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org&gt"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org&gt</A>;, or possibly on your own
system under <TT>/usr/doc/HOWTO</TT> or <TT>/usr/share/doc/HOWTO.</TT>

The  Linux Machine has 2 NIC    eth0 (10.15.1.10 | 16 ) is connected
to the internal net (hub)  , while the other ETH1 (10.16.1.10 | 16) is
connected to the DSL Modem.

You have private IPs on both interfaces. Given a DSL modem on one of
them, it would usually have an Internet-valid address, either one that
you automatically get via DHCP or a static one that you get from your
ISP (that's become unusual for non-commercial accounts.) Looks like you
have a PPPoE setup - so you're not actually going to be hooking eth0 to
eth1, but eth0 to ppp0.

This may see like a stupid question, but do the internal PCs have valid
internet address? (i.e., those outside the 10.*.*.*,
172.16.*.*-172.31.*.* or 192.168.*.* ranges) If they don't, you need to
do IP masquerading. This is not all that hard, I could give a quick &amp;
dirty answer as to how to do it (Or you could look at the
IP-Masquerading-HOWTO, for the long answer), but I'd like to know if
that's your situation first. Yes, I am <EM>that</EM> lazy.

Yep, that's what it is. That MTU of 1492 is a good hint: that's the
correct setting for PPPoE, and that's your only interface with a
Net-valid IP.

The adjusted MTU for PPPoE (from the usual 1500 to 1492) is necessary, but
can cause problems with the other machines on the LAN unless they too are
adjusted for MTU.

Right - although not quite as bad as the gateway's MTU (that one can
chase its own tail forever - looks like there's no connection!)

I've been stuck with using PPPoE for about a month now,
and have found the Roaring Penguin pkg (<A HREF="http://www.roaringpenguin.com"
	>http://www.roaringpenguin.com</A>) to
work quite well, once it's configured.  I seem to remember reading that it
does the MTU adjustment internally, and alleviates the headache of having
to adjust the rest of the machines on the LAN to use the PPPoE gateway
(see the ifconfig output below).

Oh, _sweet._ I'm not sure how you'd do that "internally", but I'm no
network-programming guru, and that would save a bunch of headaches.

Especially nice if one of the LAN nodes
is a laptop that gets carried around to different LAN environments - would
be a real PITA to have to reset the MTU all the time.

Then I just tacked on the firewall <TT>/</TT> masq script I've been using right
along, with the only change being the external interface from eth0 to
ppp0.  PPPoE is also a freak in that the NIC that connects to the modem
doesn't get an assigned IP.

Yep, that's what got me thinking "PPPoE" in the first place. Two
RFC-1918 addresses - huh? An MTU of 1492 for ppp0 and reasonably short
ping times to the Net - oh.

Yep, that's what "netstat" says. I've never done masquerading with
PPP-to-Ethernet, but it should work just fine, provided you do the
masquerading correctly.

That's probably the problem. Seriously - a firewall is nothing more than
a set of routing rules; in order to do masquerading, you need - guess
what? - some routing rules (as well as having it enabled in the kernel.)
Here are the steps in brief - detailed in the Masquerading HOWTO:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Make sure that your kernel supports masquerading; reconfigure and




<LI>Load the "ip_masq" module if necessary.



<LI>Enable IP forwarding (ensure that /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward is




<LI>Set up the rule set (the HOWTO has good examples.)

</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That's the whole story. If you're missing any part of it, go thou and
fix it until it cries "Lo, I surrender!" If you run into problems while
following the advice in the HOWTO, feel free to ask here.

One thing you didn't mention doing is turning on forwarding between the
NICs; you have to tell the Linux to forward packets from one NIC to the
other.  To see if it is turned on, do this:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
If it says "0", then it's not turned on.  To turn it on, type
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
And see if your Win boxen can see the internet.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If that is your problem, once you reboot the Linux box you'll lose the
setting.  There are two ways not to lose the setting.  One  is to put
the echo command above into your <TT>/etc/rc.local</TT> file.  The second and
Approved <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Way is to put the line
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
in your <TT>/etc/sysctl.conf</TT> file.  I don't have any Red Hat 7.3 boxes lying
around, so I don't know if Red Hat changed the syntax between 7.x and
8.x.  One way to check is to run
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/sbin/sysctl -a | grep forward
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
and see which one looks most like what I have.

It seems to me that you would want the DSL modem
(eth1) to be the default route to the internet, not the modem (ppp0).
</blockQuote>

Because maybe the problem is that I'm trying to route my internal net

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Masquerading is only a specific case (one-to-many) of NAT. As an example
of other stuff that NAT can do, IBM had an ad for the Olympics a while
back (their equipment handled all the traffic for the website); they did
"many-to-many" NAT to split up the load.
