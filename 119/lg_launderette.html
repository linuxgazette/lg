It's called 'back bacon' because... (drum roll...) it's made from the
pig's back. Better quality meat. Usually, the bacon that's made into
rashers comes from the pig's stomach (pork bellies are one of the more
important agricultural commodities), and "dinner bacon" usually comes
from the legs.
</blockQuote>

IIRC, 'back bacon' is actually ham

Hehe, so now you see?  Indeed, one thing that I am quite annoyed with
over here, is that pre-packed bacon tends to have the rashers packed
with water --- so that when you cook then (fry it, usually), it doesn't
fry but boil.  The net result is that the rasher shrinks to nothing.

Well, there are two views you can take on this. Either: a) that's the
idea, or, if you know a little more about bacon curing (which,
unfortunately, I do), b) that's an unfortunate side-effect of making
bacon more affordable.

Doner.  My mom used to make shish kebabs on a skewer, sans pita.  Yum!
A vertical lamb on a spit is a vertical lamb on a spit, not a doner or a
gyro.  Although you might call it "gyro meat".  Now, what's the
difference between these and a shaverma?  (Note: gyro is supposed to be
gyros (singular), although nobody except Greeks pronounce it that way.)

For me, there's actually a difference between Armenian and Turkish
coffee [1], although it may well be connected to the specific areas of
Armenia and Turkey from which the people who made the stuff for me have
come. (I actually have a lot more experience with Armenian coffee, even
after all these years in the US. Go figure.) I strongly suspect that
there's a lot of overlap, particularly in regions that border on each
other, but my sample set has not yet included that.

English muffin.  What a hoot.  What about Australian toaster biscuits
(which I think are called crumpets in England).  They're like an English
muffin but more solid and sweet.

Hmm.  A muffin is a muffin (unlike a crumpet, which is very airy,
muffins are somewhat more solid, and have a much more floury taste).

I was walking down the street with my son's mother, many years ago

and bumped into a man with a labrador who was coming the other way. He
said nothing, and kept going; she decided that <EM>he</EM> bumped into <EM>her</EM>
and inhaled deeply to start throwing abuse (she has a pretty short
fuse).

Whereas the missive I'd prefer to leave on a windshield or five is
caused by people with temporary (or permanent) handicap stickers, but
literally no mobility or visible handicap I can discern that warrants
being able to park specially. However, in many of these cases, I've been
able to find another reason for their markings:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
"I've been following you about to see whether the Handicapped Sticker

Mobility impairment does not necessarily manifest visually as lurching

something like congestive heart failure or some other incapacity of
stamina rather than motion.

to issue spurious placards for the benefit of

Yes.  My mom is not visibly handicapped but it's hard for her to walk
more than a block without resting, and the hot sun can exacerbate her
condition (MS).  So those handicapped parking spaces make a big
difference.  God forbid somebody should decide she's "not handicapped
enough".  People don't realize the enormity of problems handicapped
people deal with...

You might wish to know that "enormity" is <em>  not  </em> a noun used to denote
magnitude.  It means "great and notorious <em>wickedness</em>".
</blockQuote>

That's a common usage error.  I'm guessing that someone once encountered
a phrase like "sentenced for the enormity of his deeds" and erroneously
concluded that "enormity" must be something like "enormousness".  And
thus the misconception became established.

Oh, Northern Florida is quite the country unto itself. Twenty miles
inland, the whole "southern cracker" thing is alive and well - including
the slave camps (a.k.a. "labor pools", recently exposed in a few of the
local papers), the accents, the attitudes... hell, up until the late
'70s, Bunnell - about thirty or forty miles south of St. Augustine - was
the state HQ of the KKK. I take especial joy in riding through that kind

It's a high-contrast place we live in; lovely, friendly, St. Augustine

liberal arts college - and labor pools twenty miles away. Meanwhile, the
(local) accents here are an amazing lazy-mouth gumbo, damn near a
Louisiana/Alabama mush with an occassional burr thrown in for variety.
It can be lovely as a flavoring (say, in a librarian from Hastings whom I
met at a party, who sounded like fine velvet feels), but feels like a

I looked up kebab &amp; co. in the dictionary (Webster's New World), then
'dict', then meandered to Wikipedia, and along the way found out some
stuff about Old Bailey.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Webster's says both kebab and shish kebab mean cubes of marinated meat
on a skewer with onions and tomatoes. That's what my mom used to make.
When I later encountered them in pitas, I wondered, "Why would you want
to muffle the wonderful taste of a shish kebab by imprisoning it in a
pita? And why are they calling them kebabs when they're gyros?" Webster
says kebab is an Arabic word but claims shish is Armenian.
</STRONG></P>

Wikipedia discusses the variation and also gets into doners (doener,
donair).

<P><STRONG>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab"

"There are many varieties of kebab and the term means different things
in different countries. The term kebab without specifying the kind
refers to döner kebab in Europe and to shish kebab in the United States."
OK, that squares with my experience.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"Take-out gyros is quite popular in the United States where it is
usually beef and lamb, shawarma is available in ethnic neighborhoods but
döner kebab is unknown." Yes. Thomas (I think) mentioned a class
difference between gyros and doners, that gyros were acceptable but
doners were the province of yobs drinking after 11pm. Interesting that
we don't have doners, but we don't have gyros after 11pm either. We do
have yobs but they're called frat boys 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">, and their favorite food after
11pm is... nothing, just alcohol. Well, maybe late-night pizza. If you

of the most popular street foods. Originally from the former Soviet
Republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, shawarma in Russia is generally
eaten with a variety of julienned vegetables, tomato sauce, and garlic

The shavermas I got at a stand, but the pel'meni I bought frozen and
boiled at home, much to the surprise of an old WWII widow who lived in
the same communal flat. The gas stove scared me since I'd grown up with
electric, especially since you had to light it with a match. Said
babushka let me use her jar of matches. One stove in the other kitchen
always had a burner on low. I asked why. She said, so the guy doesn't
have to buy matches. (Gas was free, although electricity was, er,
metered.) I was incredulous. "He can't afford to buy a box of

Regarding bailey and Old Bailey (a courthouse in London, which I first

to bail/bailiff, and were called that for some unfathomable reason. But
Webster's says bailey is "the outer wall or court of a medieval castle;

Oddly enough, on a recent unplanned trip to London, I found myself with
an entire afternoon in which my only obligation was to travel about 7 km
to Liverpool Street Station, so I did it by shank's mare[1] -- and one
of several places I stopped to gawk was the Old Bailey.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It's so named becase it was built <em>  next to  </em> Old Bailey Street, which lay
just outside the perimeter wall -- the "bailey" -- of the mediaeval
walled city.  The original building fell to the Great Fire (1666), and

I also dropped into Hyde Park, stopped at St. Paul's Cathedral (how
could I skip that?), wandered around the "City" legal district and
the Barbican Centre, visited Dr Johnson's house, looked around the
Guildhall, and probably visited some other places I'm forgetting at the
moment.

(I had to make an unplanned side-trip into London from Glasgow because
my passport had vanished, and so I was obliged to visit the US Embassy
to get a new one.  The whole gory tale is here:

[1] Before you ask, it's an 18th C. Scottish tongue-in-cheek coinage.
"To shank it" meant "go on foot", borrowing from the English "shank" for
one's leg portion from ankle to knee:  The joke based on that expression
lay in referring to a "shank's nag" or "shank's mare" -- the mare of
your shank being your own foot, in the absence of more-luxurious
transportation.  A modern analogue would be when someone suggests I buy
some ludicrously expensive part for my bicycle to save weight, and I
rejoin that I'd be "better off concentrating on lightening the bike motor".

And "bail" is
the convergence of no less than four different words:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(1) [Old French baillir: to keep in custody, deliver] money deposited
with the court to get an arrested person temporarily released.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(2) [Old French baille, bucket] a bucket or scoop for dipping up water
and removing it from a boat. What Ben will be doing when he gets back to
Florida.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(3) [Middle English beil, from Old Norse beygla, to bend] a hoop-shaped
support for a canopy, a hoop-shaped handle for a bucket or kettle, a bar
on a typewriter to hold the paper against the platen
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(4) [Old French baile, from Latin bajulis, porter; this one is related
to bailey] formerly an outer fortifictation made of stakes, a bar or
pole to keep animals separate in a barn, a Cricket wicket.
</STRONG></P>

Nope - works fine as a retrospective (which, given your long gray beard,
shambling gait, absence of teeth, and the vacant look of someone who
lives almost totally in the past, is highly apropos.

I really enjoyed reading this thing, including the linked article by Ted
Nelson:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>In a way the first luncheon speaker and his enthusiasm perfectly
embodied the ideas and controversy of the conference. This was
Representative Charles Rose, who wore a strinking plaid jacket.
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
I hadn't realized that there was a portmanteau word that encompassed
"striking" and "stinking" [1]; I'm shocked by the fact that the original
Committee That Designed English omitted it, and I'm <EM>glad</EM>, well and
fully satisfied, that this terrible injustice has finally been
corrected. I will surely find many uses for it from now on - say, at the
end of every sentence, strinking.

[1] Oh, his poor audience. To be visually <em>  and  </em> olfactorily assaulted at
the same time... I'll be his voice sounded like nails on a chalkboard,
too - just to make the experience complete. That's why so many people
left the conference, as Ted reported.

Rita's looking as bad as Katrina, depending on where it lands and how much
it weakens by then.  When I woke up yesterday morning it was category 3,
when I got into work it was 5, and when I left our guys in Baton Rouge
were on the edge of evacuating.  This morning they were packing.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The media is treating these as two flukes, but there are some dozen storms
forming in the Atlantic, so a reasonable chance at least a few of them
will be nasty.  I would just go to the northeast or midwest for a couple
months to avoid the in-again-out-again.

[sigh] I wish. If NOAA had upgraded their estimate sooner, or if
everything on the boat had worked, or even - now that I've got the
welder, etc. going - if I didn't have to go to L.A., we'd be on our way
north right now. As it is, well, all I can do is hunker down and hope.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Also note that it hasn't been much of anything in the Atlantic, at least
not in the classical sense - the typical pattern being a low moving off
the coast of Africa, picking up heat and water off the edge of the ITCZ,
getting spin off the Coriolis effect, and making its first appearance on
Broadway somewhere around, oh, 17N65W. Instead, it's been "depression
forms in the Bahamas OH MY GAWD IT'S A HURRICANE!", with NOAA having
damn near zip lead time on these things - of course. Totally not their
fault, but not having that two-to-three week window to watch these
things mature is unsettling, to say the least.

There seem to be three factors converging:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1) Climate change (we're not supposed to say g%*@!% w*%!!&amp;) 
is increasing
the temperature fluctuations, exacerbating the storms.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
2) We're coming out of a 30-year calm cycle for Atlantic storms.  So
what's "extreme" now is people's short memories.  I think we've assumed
that the calm period during most of the 20th century was "normal".

comparatively.

"De hurricane, she do blow." There's two very effective ways of dealing
with a 'cane there - you either stay close to the water and build
6'-thick walls out of limestone (coral), like the Dutch did at the St.
Thomas waterfront, or you go high and build large houses with <EM>huge</EM>
shuttered windows and a strong below-ground basement (with water
storage), as they did at Mountaintop. In the second case, when the 'cane
is coming, you take all your stuff into the basement and _open the
shutters_ so your house offers nearly no resistance to the wind. After
the 'cane, you sweep out the leaves and bring your furniture back up.
Needless to say, bamboo and other light construction for said furniture
is strongly preferred...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Standard US construction - balloon frames, sheet rock, etc. - is beyond
stupid. And yet, most people in the islands do it - because those are
the construction methods and materials that are available.
