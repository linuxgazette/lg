<P> 1. refer to a dictionary so you are sure which definition of "hack" you want 
   to use.  There is a nice 2c Tip this month about visiting Mirrian Webster's
   dictionary website, or you might find the 
   <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/">Jargon File</A> (aka. The New Hacker's Dictionary) useful.

<P> 2. follow directions for the right definition.

<P> a. I recommend starting with a light axe and smaller pieces of firewood.  As 
   you work on bigger pieces you may want to use a hammer and wedge.  The
   best thing is that poor practice results with the smaller wood leads to 
   kindling size pieces, which are also needed for a good fireplace setup.  
   
<P> By all means, don't forget to seriously clean the flue before using your 
   fireplace the first time in a season.  You can seriously smoke yourself
   out if you forget that, and carbon monoxide, being invisible, is especially
   dangerous.

<P> b. Most Linux distributions make it easy to find source code for its tools.
   Start with things which are shell scripts.  Then learn perl, and study
   things which are perl scripts.  Learning a minimal amount of C will allow
   you to look at the source code of "small" programs like ls or cat.  As
   your talents grow you might feel inclined to look at the kernel, or other
   large programs that everyone uses.  All the while make your own practice
   programs and try to do things which are useful for your own purposes.  When
   these things are useful patches or programs to others, post them to project
   maintainers or start up your own thing (maybe at Sourceforge).

<P> If the terms in this description are not "plain english" to you, you are
   not yet ready to be a code hacker.

<P> c. th11s 11z != a cr@ckERz d-N d00d!  Find an IRC channel somewhere.  Try not
   to get caught doing anything the al-Qaeda would do.  Expect a lump of coal
   in your stocking if you manage to hurt anybody with your internet joyride.
   
<P> /me cackles wickedly while splitting the next email thread with a medium size 
wedge and light axe.

<P> I'm so sorry, Thomas; all my riffles are currently in use. Those darn

<P> Seriously, though - I'm not very much of a Linux zealot; other people are

indeed attempt to proselytize those who are stuck with OSs that they hate -

<P> Riffle?  That's the fast water between pools in a stream.

<P> I'd be pretty scared if somebody was pointing a riffle at me;
Lessee, small stream, maybe 5m across, .25m average depth,
that's 1.25 m**2 cross section, if the riffle is 15m long
that's 18.75 m**3 of water, plus surrounding streambed.  I wanna
be pretty well clear of anybody strong enough to lift that,
let alone point it!!!



<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]

<P> It's also what you call a gold-separating trough, as well as the stuff at
the bottom of it (these days, a lot of folks use Astro-Turf. <shrug> Go
figure.)

<P> That was what I was riffing on... :)


<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Dan]

<P> Yeah, I don't know anything about gold-separating troughs.  Tho I can
see how it'd be called a "riffle" ... region of faster-moving water, with
maybe some bumps to it.  Calling its bed a "riffle" seems like
taking some liberty with the term, but I guess you need to call it
something, and maybe "bed" doesn't sound obscure enough.

<P> My spelling is terrible, lol.....

<P> Thanks for picking that one out Dan. I'd be scared if
someone was pointing a river at me!!

<P> Also, I would just like to point out that you are
wrong about what a "riffle" is.

<P> Ehem.....having done A-Level Geography, a "riffle" is
created from turbulent flow, which only occurs within
meanders.....

<P> so that means that you'll be pointing a bendy river

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

<P> Try walking some trout streams.  Mostly they don't meander,
at least in this mountainous part of the country, but you'll 
find pools and riffles alternating nonetheless.  Smooth
and turbulent flow.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]

<P> If I recall correctly from my trout-fishing days, "head-pool-run-riffle" is
the repeated structure that makes up a mature stream. The length of the
sequence is mainly dependent on the stream width and rate of flow. As Dan
says, most of them don't meander; this structure is a result of the water
carrying silt, building up a restriction where it settles, speeding up
through the restriction, and slowing down as it exits.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather]

<P> Oh, so <EM>that's</EM> where you get the trout cluebats to flog people
with.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Dan]

<P> Real streams are contingent things, at least at the scale of
human beings, full of rock outcrops, changes in the lie of the land, 
slide debris, logs and other noise.  And silt, carried predictibly by 
faster water to deposit in slower water.  Also gravel, cobbles, and 
bolders, carried during the spate when the babbling brook becomes 
the raging torrent, its flow influenced by factors ordinarily far above 
its waterline.  As it erodes slowly headward, carrying all to
lower ground, the things it can reach, first, the rest, later.

<P> Surprising how hard it is to get a model stream running on a
uniform substrate to behave according to the model.  I've tried.
Enough to wonder to what extent the patterns we see in streams are 
just our poor minds seeking to impose order where there lies only chaos.

<P> Though I must vouch for the repetition of the pool-and-riffle
pattern.  With, as Ben says, each pool having head and tail, 
each with their own implications for the behavior of the elusive
trout.  

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]

<P> Oh, definitely. Dan... you've got me thinking about four-pound test, and
turning over rocks for bait, and rationalizing that maybe the water isn't
all <EM>that</EM> cold yet. It just ain't fair, I tell ya... I've done close to
zero freshwater fishing in the past ten years; it's all been big-game
saltwater stuff - 1/4" nylon line, 6 feet of solid stainless steel wire for
leader, 7/0 forged SS hooks baited with a foot-long ballyhoo, and /sauve
qui peut/ once you hook into the big bastard. As much fun as that can be,
I've just realized how much I've missed the fine, subtle game that trout
fishing can be. Well... they _did_ just open a new Outdoor World near
here... I think I've got a field trip coming up tomorrow, with a bit of
local stream research thrown in. <grin>

<P> Just where the pool meets that enticing little backwater, slightly to the

of his ride on the night of Apr. 18, 1775, to warn the people of the
Massachusetts countryside that British soldiers were being sent out in
the expedition that, as it turned out, started the American
Revolution....  it is Revere who is remembered as the midnight rider,
chiefly because of the poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow."

<P> <A HREF="http://eserver.org/poetry/paul-revere.html">Paul Revere's Ride</A>
by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        Listen my children and you shall hear<BR>
        Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,<BR>
        On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;<BR>
        Hardly a man is now alive<BR>
        Who remembers that famous day and year.

    <P> He said to his friend, "If the British march<BR>
        By land or sea from the town to-night,<BR>
        Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch<BR>
        Of the North Church tower as a signal light,--<BR>
        One if by land, and two if by sea;<BR>
        And I on the opposite shore will be,<BR>
        Ready to ride and spread the alarm<BR>
        Through every Middlesex village and farm,<BR>
        For the country folk to be up and to arm." ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The most famous quote here is, "One if by land, two if by sea."

<P> We learned the poem in elementary school.  Although looking
back, there's no way we could have understood since I had
no concept of what Middlesex or a farm or a belfry was.

	<P> I believe that the correct term nowadays is "bisexual", and

	<P> Of course, Middlesex is an area of Massechussetts, which was named after
	a region in England.
	Although, us Yanks never could understand how Brits can use terms like
	Middlesex and Sussex while keeping a straight face.

<P> Paul Revere was also a silversmith, and there's still a line of
high-quality pots and pans ("Revere ware") named after him.  He also
forged pewter utinsels, I think.

<P> Why, he never! Paul Rever, a forger? I won't believe it! I'm sure that his
pewter utensils were perfectly original. &lt;sniff&gt;

<P> (Note: Pewter is cast, not forged.)

<P> &lt;Smile&gt; I remember the '1 if
by LAN, 2 if by C' (erm... it _sounds_ right...) &lt;shrug&gt; I thought he
rode horses and yelled at people for a living, or something.

<P> Can be used for taking depth soundings also.

<P> Another use for a dead drive: it contains a couple of magnets
that are GREAT for picking up small ferromagnetic items, such
as spilled machine screws or carpet tacks.  Also useful for confining 
map pins and paper clips to one corner of the desk drawer.  I wouldn't 
be without one!  In fact I have a couple in my desk drawer, some
in each toolbox, and the kids each have a couple to play with.

<P> Just don't stick it on the fridge.  Might be useful for holding small
piles of recipes, but don't stick it to the fridge without a generous
cushion or it may chip the paint.

<P> Many drives are assembled with odd drivers for the screwheads.  To
disassemble, use a small drill to remove the screwheads, when you
find you don't have a suitable driver.

<P> This is also good info for the person who wanted advice on starting a
cybercafe.  The chipped paint may make the health department inspectors
nervous.

<P> &lt;shrug&gt; Then you'd just use the magnet to stick <EM>them</EM> to the fridge,
until they realize that chipped paint is wonderful, no, they have no
problems with it <EM>whatsoever</EM>, it was all a mistake...

<P> Action Surplus in Sunnyvale, California has all the bastard spawn
"security through strange screwhead" drivers.

<P> Save the cheap Allen wrenches you get with stuff to assemble it -- you
can hammer an Allen wrench into some of those strange screws, then turn
it (if you don't want the screw afterward)


<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

<P> &lt;Evil Genius laugh&gt; A Dremel tool with a steel-cutting disk makes a "flat"
screw out of any of those strange ones in about three seconds. I have
reason to know...


<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

<P> I've done this too but the ones on hard drives are countersunk
below the level of the drive frame.  You could cut a slot if you
were willing to cut the drive frame too.

<P> The phrase "compare and contrast" raises warning bells because it sounds
like a homework question, so my instinctive answer is, "Figure it out
for yourself.  That's why your teacher/professor gave you the question."

<P> However, we may feel inclined to give some amusing answers if you give
us more precise information.  "The manual system" of what?  Playing
chess on a computer vs a chessboard has a different impact than word
processing on a computer vs a typewriter, and both are different from
engineering with a computer vs engineering without, or building
animation movies on a computer vs in Walt Disney's day.
