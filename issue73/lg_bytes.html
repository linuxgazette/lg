Bad news from the European Patent office. It appears that they are just
itching to get a piece of the software-patents action their American
colleagues have been hogging. 
<a href="http://www.eurolinux.org/news/coup01A/">Eurolinux</a> have
<a href="http://www.eurolinux.org/news/coup01A/">
reported</a>
that the president of the European Patent Office has, "in preemption of political
decisions to be taken by European governments, decreed a regulation that
authorises patent claims to computer programs". The updated rules are
<a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/gui_lines/e/c_iv_2.htm">
available online</a> along with a 
<a href="http://www.epo.co.at/news/pressrel/2001_10_05_e.htm">
related memo</a>.
<p>
The outrage at this stems
both from strong feeling against software patents per se, and from the
undemocratic nature of their introduction. As 
<a href="http://interactif.lemonde.fr/article/0,5611,2866--246575-0,FF.html">
reported</a> by the French daily, Le Monde, European governments had
already made a decision to postpone changes to the articles in question
until further study had been done into the potential ramifications. 
<p>
A 
<a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/vreji/papri/bmwi-fhgmpi01/indexen.html">
study</a> commissioned by the German Federal Ministery of Economy and
Technology (BMWi) found that introduction of software patents would be
likely to put many currently successful software companies out of business
and slow down innovation in the software field (perversely, that report
then went on to <i>recommend</i> the introduction of these patents).
A European Commission 
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/softanalyse.pdf">
consultative report</a> [pdf]
found that 91% of respondants where opposed to software patents. However,
it appears that the "economic majority" was in favour of patents. So much
for democracy.
<p>
There are several fine online resources available if you want to
familiarise yourself about the issues regarding software patents.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.eurolinux.org/news/coup01A/">Eurolinux</a> is a leading
opponent of these "advances". Their
<a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org/">
Petition for a Software Patent Free Europe</a> is supported by 80000
signatures. Why not add your own?
<li>
The
<a href="http://www.ffii.org/indexen.html">
Federation for a Free Informational Infrastructure</a> also have a wide
range of news and information on these issues. In particular, there is a 
<a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/stidi/epc52/indexen.html">guide</a> to the
Interpretation and Revision of the crucial Article 52.

Slashdot
<a href="http://slashdot.org/yro/01/11/09/1322254.shtml">
reported</a>  on the signing of the new
<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/cadreprojets.htm">
European Cybercrime Treaty</a>. The final version is available 
<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/projets/FinalCybercrime.htm">
here</a>. It is effectively a template to be used by signatory countries
when framing laws concerning crime committed using computers.
As
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4306273,00.html">
reported</a> by The Guardian, the treaty: "...outlines common definitions
of computer-related crimes, defines the methods for criminal investigations
and prosecution and establishes methods of international communication
between law enforcement officials."
<p>
Though some
<a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011121/wr/crime_internet_dc_1.html">
comment</a> has been favourable, many civil rights groups have
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1651000/1651381.stm">
condemned</a> the treaty on the grounds that it grants excessive powers to
police forces while eroding privacy. One consolation (as noted last
month) that Bruce Schneier has 
<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0108.html#8">
highlighted</a> is the explicit statement in the treaty of the legitimacy
of using "hacking/cracking" tools in 
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2001/11/15/scanning.htm">
security work</a> (as opposed to using them to rob banks!).
Nevertheless, there is still strong cause for concern as the provisions for
extradition and cross border action could be subject to tragic abuse.

The European Cybercrime treaty will not be of much interest to the United
Kingdom Government, as they seem to have implemented many of the most
draconian measures already.  In the current climate of terrorist fear,
things are being locked down even more tightly. New measures being
introduced by David Blunket (UK Home Secretary) will give law enforcement
bodies access to records of all UK telephone and internet users. This was
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4293489,00.html">
reported</a> in The Guardian. This access will not only be available for terrorism
investigations, but also for investigations regarding minor crimes and tax
issues.
This is basically an extension/clarification of the 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/19276.html">
much criticised</a>
<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/ripa/ripact.htm">
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</a> which gave the government
unprecedented powers to monitor communications with very little outside
scrutiny or even the need for a court order. Apparently, it is
"inappropriate" to involve judges in the process where issues of national
security or economic well-being are involved. An article in <i>Criminal Law
Review</i> described this assertion as 
<a href="http://www.cyber-rights.org/documents/crimlr.pdf">
"wholly spurious"</a>.

<FONT COLOR="green">Judge Refuses Adobe Injunction Against Reseller of OEM Software
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> 
In a case that impacts the questions of (1) whether software is
"licensed" or "sold" and (2) the validity of End User License Agreements
(EULAs), a US district judge has 
<a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/bb61c530eab0911c882567cf005ac6f9/574aa79ff518021188256aed006ea2dc/$FILE/CV00-04161DDP.pdf">
denied</a> [pdf]
Adobe a preliminary injunction
against SoftMan Products Company for reselling Adobe software that was
originally bundled with computers in OEM fashion but that the computers'
owners did not want.

<P> The judge rejected Adobe's claim that the bundled copy was a "license"
rather than a "sale".  Thus, the First Sale doctrine applies, meaning
Adobe cannot control the subsequent transfer of the the software
after the initial sale.  
The court also found that SoftMan was not bound by the EULA because it
had never assented to it.  The validity of EULAs was also questioned
as the terms were not fully disclosed prior to the sale.
Linux Journal has more 
<a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5628">
details</a>.
<P> 
Linux Weekly News also has an informative
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1108/">
editorial</a> 
that examines how this ruling might affect other cases. One implication is
that it should be possible (if the principle of first sale now applies) to
resell e-books or unwanted OS installations. The ruling may also be
important to the
two DeCSS cases (the famous one and another one). These cases
"depend, partly, on
the claim that a commercial DVD package was 'improperly' reverse
engineered. It is the software's EULA that prohibits that
reverse engineering. If the code is reverse engineered without
installing it and agreeing to the EULA (by, say, disassembling it on a
Linux system), the EULA may not apply".

</FONT>
</H3> 

Slashdot
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/11/01/1953236&mode=nested">
reported</a>
that in the California DeCSS case, a
court of appeal overturned the injunction
imposed by a lower court. Quoting: 'In the case
of a prior restraint on pure speech, the hurdle is substantially
higher [than for an ordinary preliminary injunction]: publication must
threaten an interest more fundamental than the First Amendment
itself. Indeed, the Supreme Court has never upheld a prior restraint, even
faced with the competing interest of national security or the Sixth
Amendment right to a fair trial.' This is obviously a very positive
development, though there is a long road still to be travelled.
<p>
<hr width="20%" noshade>
<p>
Less positively, in the New York MPAA v. 2600 case, the court of appeals
decision has gone in the favour of the MPAA. There are reports on the
judgement available 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/23084.html">
here</a> [TheRegister.co.uk] and 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/effector/HTML/effect14.37.html#III">
here</a> [EFF.org]. Cryptome.org has a very through 
<a href="http://cryptome.org/cryptout.htm#DVD-DeCSS">
collection</a>
of documents relating to both cases, including the
<a href="http://cryptome.org/mpaa-v-2600-cad.htm">text of the ruling</a>.
The judge accepted that computer code can be protected as a form of speech
under the first ammendment. He then decided that the target of the
injunction was not the <i>speech</i>, but the functional component (i.e.
the use the code can be put to: decrypting DVD's). In these circumstances,
the injunction can be granted as long as it is "content neutral", and the
impact on the speech component is incidental. The judge
writes:
<blockquote>
This type of regulation is therefore content-neutral, just as would be a
restriction on trafficking in skeleton keys identified because of their
capacity to unlock jail cells, even though some of the keys happened to
bear a slogan or other legend that qualified as a speech component.
</blockquote>
The other part of the rationale is that the Government's interest in the
prevention of unauthorised access to copyrighted material "is
unquestionably substantial". Thus, the injunction is upheld. A similar
argument is used relating to the injunction against linking to web pages
containing DeCSS.
<p>
Claims against the injunction based on the principle of fair use were
dismissed on the grounds that although the user is allowed to make fair use
(say, by quoting from a copyright work) she is not automatically entitled
to make that use with a preferred technology. CSS may prevent you taking a
still image from a movie, but it does not stop you from photographing your
monitor/television screen. Thus, your fair use rights are not affected.
<P>
The issue as to whether or not DeCSS is really a piracy tool was relegated
to footnote 5. The footnote correctly states that piracy is entirely possible
without DeCSS, but contends that DeCSS is a substantial aid to the process.
Many would 
<a href="http://www.opendvd.org/journalists.php3">
contend</a> that the piracy issue is actually a canard (=bogus), but
it is the most respectable argument the MPAA can come up with.
<p>
Note: I am not a lawyer (as they always say on Slashdot), and
this interpretation is based on a quick reading of the ruling just before
this month's deadline. However, I believe that the summary above is a fair
representation of the major points. As to the correctness of the ruling/opinions,
you must make up your own mind. Personally, some of the distinctions seem
a touch specious. The separation of speech and function with regard to
computer code is not as clear as in the case of the logo on a key, or a
poem written on a gun. Also, the issue of fair use regarding the
<i>playing</i> of legally purchased DVD's on Linux was summarily dismissed,
apparently on the basis that you have the right to watch, not decrypt,
DVD's you purchase, thus subsection 1201(a)(3)(A) of the 
<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_bills&docid=f:h2281enr.txt.pdf">

	account of the Felten vs RIAA hearing</A>.  As you remember, Professor
Felton write a paper describing weaknesses in the CSS encryption used on
commercial DVDs.  RIAA threatened to sue him if he presented the paper at a
scientific conference.  But they didn't sue him, and after a public outcry
they withdrew their objection to him presenting the paper.  Meanwhile, Felten
filed a lawsuit of his own, claiming that RIAA's action encourages researchers
to censor themselves to avoid legal liability that may or may not be 
legitimate.  The judge dismissed the suit,
saying that he cannot rule on a potential issue (RIAA threatening to sue
Felten), but only on an actual issue (if RIAA sued him, which they didn't).
He said he is not allowed to rule on Constitutional issues (whether Felton's
free-speech rights were violated) in a non-criminal case without a compelling
reason, and there is no compelling reason in this case.  He also said this case
is like "night and day" compared to Dmitry Sklyarov's case, since Dmitry <EM>was</EM>

<P> 
In less positive news,
The Electronic Frontier Foundation published a
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Intellectual_property/P2P/Napster/20010226_rgross_nap_essay.html">
white paper</a>
on the US appeals court decision confirming that Napster was
liable for its users sharing copyrighted files.
The court agreed that the file-sharing technology in itself is not
illegal, but the minute its developers and users receive reasonable
knowledge that specific infringing files are servable on the system
(e.g., if they receive a "cease and desist" letter), they must
immediately delete these files or they, and possibly their ISP and so on
upline, will be liable.  Knowledge of infringing uses overshadows
whatever non-infringing uses the server may also be performing.  In
practice, this will have the effect of deletion through intimidation, or
deleting files that are alleged to infringe but may not.  It also forces
sysadmins to become their own police for the benefit of the content
companies, or face liability.  Technologies such as 
<a href="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/">
Freenet</a> that are
unable to police user access may have an advantage under this ruling.

Article</a> 
at

<a href="http://www.rimbault.net/python/">
Here</a> is a large list of links to Python sites  and resources. Lots and
lots of information, including a selection of links to French language

Deepak, from Bangalore, India, submitted a link to his 
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/netmaniac00/stuffs.html">
webpage</a>  
where he has a PowerPoint presentation available for download. The title of
the presentation is "The (R)Evolution of an OS", and it provides a very
thorough broad-based introduction to Linux for people who may be familiar
only with Windows.
The slideshow is "95% StarOffice compatible", but even if you don't have
Powerpoint or StarOffice, you can also see thumbnails and full-size jpegs
of the individual slides.

<P>
Ernesto Hernandez-Novich suggested that we plug the 
<a href="http://www.linux.org.ve/">
Venezuelan Linux User's Group</a> and their 
<a href="http://www.linux.org.ve/archivo">
mailing list archive</a>. Linux Gazette is always pleased to be able to
alert readers to public linux resources.
A great way to promote a new or existing Linux Users' Group (LUG) 
is to register the LUG at
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/glue">
GLUE</a>
(Groups of Linux Users Everywhere).

<a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/">
LinuxDevices.com</a> have a 
<a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT6553340334.html">
Review</a> of Sharp PDA running Linux. This was  also
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/11/05/2359227&mode=nested">
highlighted</a>
on Slashdot, which linked to an infoSync

<P> Not Linux, but <A HREF="http://www.gatt.org/">www.gatt.org</A> is a satire of the WTO
web site from the viewpoint of anti-globalization activists.  The real WTO web site,
<A HREF="http://www.wto.org/">www.wto.org</A>, allegedly had a statement deploring this
pseudo-site.  In a comical turnaround, the satire site now has an article (at the bottom of
the home page) titled "Fake WTO site misleading public", with a link to the "fake" site
that is actually the <EM>real</EM> WTO site!

Kernel 2.4.16 has been released, fixing an
unmounting bug in 2.4.15 (released just recently) that causes fs
corruption. The changelog for the first pre-version of 2.4.17 is available
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-11-28-015-20-NW-KN">
here</a>
2.4.x maintenance has been passed to Marcelo Tosatti.  But the horrible
bug was Linus' fault, not his.  ("I inherited this mess from the
previous administration," is what a US president would say.)
<p>
A new development series has been started, 2.5.x.  However, 2.5.0 is
the same as 2.4.15, so it has the same horrible bug.  In other words,
don't use it.
LWN have <a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1129/kernel.php3">reported</a> the
availability of a 2.5.1-pre3 prepatch that fixes this bug. No major changes
(cleanups and fixes mostly).  This ends the over-a-year hiatus in which there
was no development kernel.

<P> 
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/">
CNet</a> recently 
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-7720536.html?tag=owv">
reported</a> that
"Amazon.com was able to cut $17 million in technology expenses in the
last quarter largely because of a switch to Linux." This was also
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/22576.html">
reported</a> at The Register who have links to Amazon's SEC filing.
<P>
Before everyone starts predicting the demise of Windows, its worth pointing
out that this gain was
<a href="http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=23086">
at the expense of</a> UNIX servers (WinInfo). Still it is certainly encouraging.
Especially so in light of The Register's report of a 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/22770.html">
Microsoft memo</a> describing Linux as  "<i>the</i> long-term
threat against our core business.  Never forget that!". You should really
take a look at The Reg's report: the
original memo is included at the end of the page, complete with references
to butt-tattoos (don't ask!). The contents indicate that MS sees Linux as
being an obstacle to their plan of replacing UNIX servers with MS powered
(there's an oxymoron) servers. Sales folk are urged to identify UNIX
systems in their customer's organisations, and then focus on getting MS
into those functions (presumeably before some geek slips Linux in).
(Story also
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/11/12/136243&mode=nested">
featured</a> on Slashdot.)
<p>
This  brings to mind the 
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween">
Halloween memo</a> of 1998. To refresh your memory of the documents, and
also on the intervening history, take a look at LWN's
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1101/">
editorial</a> 
revisiting the memos.  They ask--and answer--the question "How many of the
predictions came true?"

</FONT>

Last month we briefly reported on the issue of 
<a href="http://www.msn.com/">MSN</a> not working with non-Internet
Explorer browsers, and <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera Software</a>'s
comments on the situation. Since then, Opera have issued a 
<a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/20011101.html">
press release</a> detailing apparent inaccuracies/spin being fed into the
media by Microsoft spokespeople. Also, not all site features are made
available to non "MSIE 5" browsers. Seems the only way to get proper service
is to set the browser identity to "MSIE 5". These kinds of behaviour
(taking the Opera statement at face value) bode ill for the future of the
open internet.

Compaq  has followed through on its promise to GPL its NSC, or Non Stop
Clusters code (the
code that SCO licensed and co-developed as UnixWare Non Stop
Clusters).  Compaq announced two projects - The CI Project (for the
infrastructure) and SSI.
"...and here with one blow is a pretty comprehensive applications platform:
Oracle can failover from node to node", Peter Braam.

<P>
On the commercial front,
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> have introduced the world's first
pre-packaged Linux cluster, a powerful and scalable system that has been
optimized for e-business.
The IBM eServer Cluster meets the demand of corporate customers who
have neither the time nor inclination to "roll their own" Linux clusters
from a collection of mismatched piece parts. They want an easy-to-order
system delivered  and supported by  a single vendor.
IBM gave no link to the press release.
