I'm trying to use netpipes to implement some file transfer automation,
but the documentation that comes with netpipes is beyond my
techno-knowledge (no explanation on the options, only some examples). A

think a "Guide to NetPipes" is a good thing. Or it is lacking audience?

I think if something works well and there's no audience for it, it

<P>
I have just been looking at your OO programming articles on C++ and Python.
Might I suggest an article on Smalltalk as well. As a Smalltalk programmer
by profession I cannot praise this language too highly. There are a couple
of alternative Smalltalks for Linux, one being Visual Works (a
non-commercial version being available for download at
<A HREF="http://www.cincom.com/smalltalk/downloads.html"
	>http://www.cincom.com/smalltalk/downloads.html</A>) and the other being Squeak
(<A HREF="http://www.squeak.org"
	>http://www.squeak.org</A>). I personally have not used Squeak but I have heard
it is very good if not quite as polished as Visual Works. I do all of my
personal code development on Linux using Visual Works. Having been a C++
programmer for over 5 years I would hate go back now.
</P>
<P>
You can obtain information on this excellent language at the Smalltalk
Webring (<A HREF="http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?index;ring=smalltalk"
	>http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?index;ring=smalltalk</A>) and at
the Smalltalk Industry Council site (<A HREF="http://www.stic.org"
	>http://www.stic.org</A>).
</P>
<P>
I think is it worthy of serious consideration in your excellent magazine.

<P>
Windows users can have free ISP access from netzero.com, juno.com,
altavista.com, excite.com, freeinternet.com, and others (see
computerbits.com, latest edition). I use two free ISPs. They work just fine,
considering they save me $240/year. For me and I'm sure others in this
world, $240/year is important.
</P>
<P>
I like using Linux, and would use it solely, if I could get free ISP with
it. But the free ISP world seems to be accessible only via Windows. So I
have a dual boot system, Windows98 or RedHat6.2. I do my net surfing in
Windows for downloads, then mount/copy my download files to Linux later.
</P>
<P>
Is this the best I can do? Is anyone thinking of setting up a free ISP
system, supported by advertising, for Linux? If not, why not?
</P>
<P>
Linux is a great server OS. It would become a more popular home OS if it
could access free internet services.
</P>

<p><em>It's worth noting that he used a free email service to send this in.

<FONT COLOR="navy">Replacing an MS Exchange Mail Server with Linux</FONT></H3>
Tue, 1 Aug 2000 13:16:37 -0500
<BR>From: "Jonathan Hutchins" &lt;hutchins@opus1.com&gt;

<P>
This is a sort of follow on to your discussion in Issue 56 of reasons not to
migrate a Linux mailserver to MS Exchange.
</P>
<P>
One feature that the MS Exchange Server/Outlook Client ( as well as the
Lotus Notes Server/Client) offers is a centralized address book.  If I want
to send mail to Jim Smith, I just enter "Jim Smith" in the address line.
The Client software queries the Server, which looks in whatever address
books I've configured, and find's jsmith@region1.somewhere.com.  When Jim
transfers to the Tucson office, his address on the Server is updated, and
new messages addressed to Jim Smith will go to
jsmith2@region3.somewhere.com.
</P>
<P>
This also works for outside addresses, the central address book can have one
entry for <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A>, instead of 10,000 entries in each of 10,000 address
books on 10,000 workstations.  If your address changes, it only has to be
updated once on the server, not 10,000 times, and you don't end up having to
write 10,000 people to tell each of them you're address has changed.  For
small sites, this is the real advantage of this feature.  Even on my home
network, I can maintain a single address book, and when a relative changes
their address, both Outlook and MS Word can look up the correct address in a
single database.
</P>
<P>
So far, I have yet to figure out a way to implement this kind of feature on
Linux workstations.  The internal address scheme could probably be handled
using Netscape as a mail client and an LDAP server, but I don't know how we
would handle the external address book.
</P>
<P>
The only possible solution I've found so far is IF IBM releases a Lotus
Notes client for Linux. which they were supposed to do last year.  I haven't
heard any further than the rumor that they MIGHT release it some day.
</P>

Hi,
</P>
<P>
I understand that Linux 6.2 (and most likely any following versions)
have support for Novell's NDS via ncpfs. And that the IPX-HOWTO explains how
to configure ncp client via ncpmount.
</P>
<P>
However;
<ol>
<li> I could not determine how to configure NDS Tree, or Context.  Is this
possible? If so how?
<li> Since our Novell file servers have been taken up to NDS Patch 8, the
Linux boxes can no longer connect to Novell file servers.
<li> Is there any documentation on how to configure the NDS side of ncpfs
or ixp?
<li> Is there any configuration files that I can configure for the above.
<li> What documentation is there for ipx_configure and what it configures.
And other ixp tools
</ul>
<P>
George.

<BR>From: Bruno Barberi Gnecco &lt;<A HREF="mailto:brunobg@psi.com.br"
	>brunobg@psi.com.br</A>&gt;

<P>
Though the series have covered pretty well the "hardware" part --- how
to bind, etc --- I have found the software part disappointing. I have always
wanted to print some books, but basically for laziness I ended printing in
the single sided, A4 format and brought to the nearest copy place to add a
cheap plastic cover and spiral binding. Good for software documentation, bad
for real books that I wanted to keep in the shelves, instead of in the middle
of one of the piles of my desk. Reducing the images by half made the letters
too small, and didn't look like a real book --- too many lines.
</P>
<P>
I suppose here that you want to print a book that you have the TeX
source, or some format that you can output to PostScript modifying the page
setup and, therefore, the layout. You may have trouble with texts with
figures, since usually the author cared about their size and position. You'll
have to follow the #1 law of laboratories: "If you don't know what's going
to happen, protect your eyes and tell your buddy to do it".
</P>
<P>
The idea is to print in A5 format. If you don't know, a A5 page is
exactly half of an A4 page, cut parallel to the smallest side (works for
all A? pages: A3 is two A4 pages joined by the larger side). So, you can
print two A5 pages in one A4 page, without reducing; and A5 pages are the
size of a book. Talk about nice.
</P>
<P>
First thing to do is to get the PSUtils package. This is a nice set
of utilities that will most of your needs of manipulating PS files. Get
them at: ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pub/ajcd or ftp.tardis.ed.ac.uk/users/ajcd.
Compile and install.
</P>
<P>
Generate the PostScript file. If you're using LaTeX, you can do it
using something like:
</P>
<Pre><BLOCKQuote>
\documentclass[a5paper]{book}
</BLOCKQuote></Pre>
<P>
I had a problem here: when I tried to generate in the A5 format, the page
was cut in half. It turned out that the problem was in dvips. If you have
this problem, find the file config.ps (probably in
<TT>/usr/share/texmf/dvips/config</TT>) And add the following lines:
</P>
<Pre><BLOCKQuote>
@ a5 149mm 210mm
@+ ! %%DocumentPaperSizes: a5
@+ %%BeginPaperSize: a5
@+ a5
@+ %%EndPaperSize
</BLOCKQuote></Pre>
<P>
Alternatively, you can use the following trick:
</P>
<Pre><BLOCKQuote>
\geometry{verbose,paperwidth=149mm,paperheight=210mm}
</BLOCKQuote></Pre>
<P>
on the beginning of your LaTeX file. Now convert your file to PostScript,
and check it to confirm that it's really in the A5 format, and not cropped
in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
Now comes the PSUtils. Though Mark Nielsen used mpage, it will not
work for this task well, since it will reduce the page. In the PSUtils
package there's an utility called pstops, which is very powerful. To
do what Mark did with mpage, type the following commands:
</P>
<Pre><blockquote>
pstops "4:3L(21cm,0)+0L(21cm,14.85cm)" file.ps file1.ps
<BR>pstops "4:1L(21cm,0)+2L(21cm,14.85cm)" file.ps file2.ps
</blockquote></Pre>
<P>
There is also psbook, which let's you print in large paper with a multiple
of 4 pages per side, so you can fold it and it will really be like a book.
The problem is to find a printer that accepts A0 paper. It's useful, however,
if you can print in A3 paper, because you could print 8 pages in a single
sheet (four A5 in each side).
</P>

<ol>
<li> Because the first versions of Python didn't have classes; they were
added later.  Languages such as Python and Perl which had classes grafted
into them later tend to have that 'self' argument explicit, so that
they can leverage the existing function-call code which expects all
formal parameters to be explicit.  ("Formal parameters" are the placeholder
arguments in the function definition.)
<li> Because Python's author preferred to make it explicit in the syntax
rather than hide it.  So that people wouldn't forget it's there, I
guess.

Guys/Gals,
</P>
<P>
Searched for info on how to make Canon bjc-250 work under <A HREF="http://linux.corel.com/">Corel</A> Linux.
(1 found)
Also found $.02 tip re: Netscape
</P>
<P>
These are both dated 1998. I'm sure these issues have been resolved by
now.
</P>

<blockquote><em>Usually tips are posted to us because someone found
	or made a solution for themselves.  That's why they're Two 
	Cent Tips.   Netscape has come a long way since then, but still
	takes a command line argument for printing - you could really
	use any application you want in the "print" dialog.
</em></blockquote>

<P>
Does the "Gazette" plan to link ancient history to today's solutions?
</P>

<blockquote><em>One of the nicer things about Linux, is that is often
	happens that even very old solutions still work... even when
	better ones become available.  I've seen means for using 
	bubblejet printers via apsfilter, and magicfilter.  There may
	be a few other things, and I'm certain there's at least one
	commercial grade print queue program.
</em></blockquote>

<P>
I thought this new- tomorrow Linux community was going to to be a
learning curve thing but I've logged more web time on it in the last two
weeks than Win (God forbid) 95 in the last two  years.
</P>

<blockquote><em>Well, yes, that's a balance point - more community, 
	so more scattered knowledge, meaning it sometimes needs to be
	chased down.  Combining it back into a form usable by ordinary
	folk is the job of the Linux Documentation Project, which the
	</em>Gazette<em> is proud to be part of.	
</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>
	Since Corel Linux is a Debian derivate, it should be possible
	to <tt>apt-get install magicfilter</tt>, then run magicfilterconfig.
</em></blockquote>

<P>
I went with Commodore Amiga (still have running box with Utah Word
Perfect) in its early stages and our user community makes the linux
groups that I've encountered so far look like Sandbox 101 for verbose
Unix programmers.
</P>
<P>
M.M.
</P>

<blockquote><em>
	Anyone want to lead him to more sites or IRC channels that
	are specifically helpful to UNIX newbies, other than a few
	websites I can immediately think of like 
	<a href="http://www.linuxstart.com">linuxstart.com</a> or 
	<a href="http://www.linuxnewbie,org">linuxnewbie,org</a>?	
</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>
	Also: Perhaps when you find the sites that work for you, you can 
	pass it along so Corel can do a better job setting new users
	up with some good bookmarks to follow in their next version. 
	We'd like to hear about it too.  And, last but not least, Linux
	Journal is looking for some hard nosed reporting on what's
	really good or bad in some of the latest distributions that
	are rolling out... if you're interested in reviewing them from
	a hard hitting attitude, contact Don Marti,

<BR>Subject: Reg. the display of email address on the gazette columns

<P> hi,

<P> I have a sugesstion on the open display of email address in the
Linux Gazette columns "Help wanted" and "2-cent tips".

<P> Currently the pages contain the email addresses in open.
This is very easy for the email bot programs to scan the page for
email address and use it for building spam-lists and sell them.

<P> I have a suggestion. Could you please consider obfuscating the
email ids as some other web news letters have started doing.

<P> For example you could obfuscate: 
user@domain.com 
 to
user at domain.com 
 or
user @ domain.com.

<P> I know this has drawbacks. Users can't click on the address in
the article to reply directly. This is a minor inconvinience and
once the user is educated about it, it shouldn't pose a problem.

<P> I am writing this, because, once I posted to usenet with my 
clear email address and I suddenly started getting a lot of spam mails.

<P> Cheers<BR>
-Sas

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[It's a tradeoff between spam obfuscation and clickable mailto links.
	For better or for worse, the tradition in </EM>LG<EM> has been 
	clickable links, and reader requests have been to make </EM>more<EM>

<BR>Subject: Linux Gazette

<P> I'm using Suse Linux 6.3 as my hobby OS. I do almost anything with it and
I'd like to ask if you still seek for authors of additional articles?  I would
really love to prepare a few articles for the gazette because I always wanted
to make a ezine. I do not have the power to create such a project myself.
Instead, I'd like to put my efforts in projects that are running. And the Linux
Gazette looks like it is ongoing project.

<P> Hi

<P> I like the design of your logo very much. Did you use Gimp to create it?

<P> If yes, i would appreciate if you could tell me how it was created.
