<P> Debian GNU/Linux 2.2, the "Joel 'Espy' Klecker" release.

<P> The Debian Project is pleased to announce the latest release of the
Debian GNU/Linux Operating System.  This release has been in
development for approximately 18 months, and has been extensively
tested by several thousand developers and end-users.

<P> With the addition of the PowerPC and ARM architectures, Debian
GNU/Linux now supports a total of six architectures -- more than any
other distribution.  Packages for all architectures are built from the
same source packages.  Debian GNU/Linux now runs on iMacs and
Netwinders, and of course Intel PC's, Sun SPARCs, Alphas, and older
Macintosh and Amiga hardware are still supported.

<P> Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 features a more streamlined and polished
installation, including automatic network setup via DHCP, a simplified
software selection process (just indicate the tasks your Debian
GNU/Linux system will be used for), and a simplified configurator for
the X Window System.  Debian GNU/Linux can be installed via CD, or
from the network and a few floppies:

<P> For detailed documentation about installing and upgrading
Debian GNU/Linux, please see 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/releases/2.2/">http://www.debian.org/releases/2.2/</A>.

<P> Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is dedicated to the memory of Joel "Espy"
Klecker, a Debian developer who, unbeknownst to most of the Debian
Project, was bedridden and fighting a disease known as Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy during most of his involvement with Debian.  Only
now is the Debian Project realizing the extent of his dedication, and
the friendship he bestowed upon us.  So as a show of appreciation, and
in memory of his inspirational life, this release of Debian GNU/Linux
is dedicated to him.

<P> Progeny is doing two things:

the latest version. Progeny Debian will have limited circulation
in pre-loads, downloads, and (probably) with third party
companies. Progeny won't be selling it directly in the stores,
although the third parties might be. Basically, Progeny Debian's
main use will be as a basis for Linux NOW.

<P> RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--July 10, 2000--Red Hat, Inc.  today announced
the Red Hat High Availability Server 1.0, a specialized version of
Red Hat Linux 6.2.

<P> Red Hat High Availability Server is an out-of-the-box clustering solution
that delivers dynamic load balancing, improved fault tolerance and scalability
of TCP/IP based applications. It lets users combine individual servers into a
cluster, resulting in highly available access to critical network resources
such as data, applications, network services, and more. If one server in the
cluster fails, another will automatically take over its workload. 

<P> The Red Hat High Availability Server has built-in
security features designed to withstand common attacks. Systems Administrators
can setup sand traps, providing for redirection of IP traffic from a potential
attacker to a secure address. Out of the box, finger, talk, wall, and other
daemons are disabled or not installed. In addition, multiple traffic routing
and scheduling techniques along with virtual IP addresses allow you to create a
security barrier for your network.

<P> Rock Linux is a distribution that's "harder to install" than the others.

<P> There, did that get your attention?  If so, Rock Linux may be for you.
It aims to be "sysadmin friendly" rather than "user friendly", to get out of
the way as much as possible from between you and your applications.  This 
means you configure the system using Unix's traditional command-line 
interface and shell scripts.  Oh yes, X-windows is included.

<P> Serious geeks will love the fact that you get to compile your own 
distribution (optionally putting it on a CD) before installing it.

Storm Firewall uses a graphical user interface to simplify the once
complex process of installing a Linux firewall.  The choice of simple
options or advanced setup gives users ultimate control over network
traffic.  In addition, users will benefit from IP masquerading which
allows for multiple computers to share a single Internet connection.

2000--MySQL AB and Sleepycat Software, Inc. today announced the release
of MaxSQL, a new Open Source, high performance, and fully transactional
SQL server. MaxSQL, developed jointly by the two companies, combines the
industry-standard interface of MySQL's data access language with the
high-performance transaction services of Sleepycat’s Berkeley DB.
MaxSQL is available immediately via download at no charge from
<A HREF="http://www.maxsql.com">www.maxsql.com</A>.

<P> MaxSQL is the first Open Source relational database engine to offer the
reliability, scalability, and performance that commercial users demand.
The software provides the ability to perform transactions with full
recoverability for committed changes. It manages databases up to 256
terabytes in size, accommodates many concurrent users, and survives
power failure or system crashes without losing data. Those features,
combined with MySQL's enormous popularity make MaxSQL a potent threat in
the SQL marketplace.

<P> The full source code for MaxSQL is available for download at <A
HREF="http://www.maxsql.com">www.maxsql.com</A>.  The software is distributed
under the GNU Public License (GPL).

<P> Salon article: "As the long arm of the law reaches Napster and its
lookalikes, programmers could be held responsible for what others do with their
code."

<P> "Free speech, copyright, piracy and the fundamental nature of source code --
ever since the Internet began its surge to cultural and economic prominence,
these concepts have swirled around each other in a confusing and contradictory
morass. Now, in courtrooms from coast to coast, judges are attempting to bring
order to the burgeoning online chaos. And from the first indications,
programmer freedom may end up coming under the most sustained assault yet
seen."

<P> "We are on the verge of defining software and determining the responsibility
of software developers to control the uses of their work."
