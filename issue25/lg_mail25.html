Subject: Help - Adding third hard drive
<p>
I've been using Slackware Linux 2.0.29 for quite some time. I've managed
with 2 drives with partitions for Win95 and Linux, but now I need to add
another drive. It is recognised in the BIOS and can be found in Windoze,
but I get no joy from Linux.
I expected to be able to mount the drive straight away. Do I need to do
some insnod or mke2fs or something.
<pre>
    # mount /dev/hdc1 /mnt
    mount: the kernel does not recognize /dev/hdc1 as a block device
           (may# fdisk /dev/hdc

    # fdisk /dev/hdc
    Unable to open /dev/hdc
</pre>
I've got a fealing that I need to reconfigure Lilo or something? I know
that I've forgotten something obvious, but I've wasted hours without any
joy.
<p>
thanx,<br>

Subject: Installing StarOffice 3.1 on Redhat 4.2
<p>
I'm having difficulties installing StarOffice onto my system.  I've
installed the rpms for static binaries, common files, english demos and
english docs.  I've run the setup script and done a user install, after
updating libc and ld.so, and would like to now run the package.  It says
to install two daemons, svdaemon and svportmap .  These both need
something called rpc and the portmap daemon, which I can find no
reference to on my system.  How can I install these so that StarOffice
will run. All help gratefully recieved.<br>

Subject: Question....
<p>
    Hello there... sorry to bother with probably one of the stupidist
questions in the world, but I want to install Linux on my computer; the
problem is that I share a computer with my family and of course they
don't have a clue of what I do so they don't care, they just want to be
able to use office to do their work.  I've looked around various Linux
sites trying to find an answer but I've been unsuccesful.  My question
is this: As I told you I have a windows95 box and all the documents that
<p>
Are outthere focus on installing linux in a DOS environment which in my
case and a lot of people it's history.  I have a 3 gig hardrive that I
think is partitioned already in 2 because I have a c: and d: I'm not
sure if they're separate hardrives or one is partitioned.  What I would
like to know is what should I do here. I'm not sure if my second drive
which is 1 gig is already formated for windows which I think it is
because it has a recyble bin.  I don't know what to do because I'm
afraid that if I delete or erase the partition the whole thing will
become one hardrive and I will have to erase everything to partition
that one hardrive.  I was kind of hoping there was a way or partitionin
my second hardrive (d:) and leave a part for windows and another for
Linux.
<p>
    As I told you earlier I'm sorry to make this kind of questions but
if I damage something of this computer my dad would prive me of even
looking at it, and I don't want that to happen.  I would really
aprecciate your help since I'm really eagered to use Linux.
<p>
Thanx in advance for your help.

Subject: HI...
<p>
I've just finished browsing your Gazzettte and it is very cool...as a web
administrator  at http://www.prplaza.net I was fedup with the
performance and  slowness of an NT enviroment and decided kind of
reluctant to migrate to Linux (right now i'm a green thumb at it)... But
and a big BUT after seen a single processor pentium pro 200 server
running linux redhat 5.0 and Apache Webserver blow the doors of a dual
pentium pro 200 running on NT and IIS3.0...i was sold in the
spot....never to touch Microsoft NT again ... and feeling good about it.
<p>
My problem is this one ... I've gone bananas in trying to find a
document that explains how to install, in a step by step fashion, the
Apache SSL "extensions"  to one of my Apache WWW Webservers (the
performance increase is awesome) can you or anyone that reads this
help...
<p>
thanks beforehand for you response....

Subject: Problems with CD-ROM
<p>
Admittedly I'm not sure where the problem lies, When using NT-4/Netscape
Communicator-4
to view the cdrom all links look like "file:///El/lj/&lt;whatever.htm&gt;"
Which of course
will not  be found.  I have looked at the source to try to find why the
double '//' and
the '/El' come from.  Any ideas? (and any work arounds??)
<p>
At the moment I don't have X running on my Linux machine - it's a new
install of
RedHat and during the upgrade I forgot to same the XConfig files.

Subject: netcfg
<p>
I am using X to connect to my ISP via the netcfg command.  I have it
starting 
up at boot time.  This works great, but I was wondering where the chat
script 
and pppd command are hiding for the ppp interface that you can create via 
netcfg. 
<p>
I was also wondering if there was a way to prevent my ISP from dropping me 
after a given time of activity.  I am using a cron job to ping to my isp,
but 
that does not seem to prevent this from happening.  Should I try pinging to
a 
server other than my ISP? 
 <p>
Thanks, Jonathan Smith.

Subject: Sound Card MED3931
<p>
I'm a new Linux user (kernel 2.0.29). My sound card
is a MED3931, with a chip OPTi 82c931.
<p>
As it is a PnP card, I use the isapnptools-1.9
package, loading the sound support as a module.
I've tried configure it as a MAD16 or MSS
(Microsoft Sound System) but it hasn't worked
in any way.
<p>
I don't know if the problem is with the IRQ/DMA/IO
settings (I use the same ones as with Windows 95)
that I set in the /etc/isapnp.conf file, or it is 
that the sound driver (OSS/Free) just doesn't
support this card.
<p>
Can you help? Thank you.

If I delete all my mails I can connect to the POP3 Server.
Error message I get is:

I have removed the account and recreated it again. Still problem occurs.
And I know I am the only one logged on.
The only way I can read my mails is manually telneting to the Linux and

Subject: IBM 8514 monitor
<p>
Hi.  I'm new to Linux, and my problem is installing my monitor, an IBM 8514,
for use with X-Window.  I use an S3 Virge 86C325 accelerator card.
<p>
After installing Red Hat 4.2, the monitor works fine for command line, but
when I try using it for X-Window, the screen shrivels up to something less
than a 3x5 recipe card!  I've tried reconfiguring different combinations of
color depths and screen resolutions, and have come up with everything from a
blank screen to 'your worst nightmare'.
<p>
I'm stumped.  I've tried the different FAQ sites, but can't find one that
can give me a hint of how to configure this monitor for use with X-Window.
I'd appreciate any help anyone can give me.  I had to resort to installing
Win95 and IE (which work for this monitor/card) just to send this out.
Thanks in advance for any help I can get.
<p>

Subject: Linux security
<p>
I'm not intending to kick of a debate of the merits of PAM, but I have a
couple of comments and a question.
<p>
The question is, has anybody, commercial or freeware, started coding an
MVS-like security system for Linux?  Specifically, I'm interested in the
fine granularity of access controls, the ability to deal with more than
just file accesses, user configurable ACLs, and most importantly,
security at the kernel level.  One thing I find most distasteful about
PAM is the fact that applications have to be PAM aware to make use of
PAM's abilities.  MVS security, on the other hand, is soft-linked into
the IO layer of the kernel, and /all/ applications use that security
model without knowing anything about it.
<p>
Anyone who has any comments on this, information, or leads, please email
me.
<p>
Thanks!
