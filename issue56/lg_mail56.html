(<a href="mailto:jecoleman@netnoir.net">jecoleman@netnoir.net</a>)

<P>
Some time ago I posted a question asking about free Linux ISPs. Lots and lots of folks were kind enough to write back telling me about FreeWWWeb, a free OS-independent ISP here in the continental USA (THANKS!).
</P>
<P>
Well, FreeWWWeb just went belly up and is trying to transition its customers to Juno.
</P>
<P>
That leaves Linux users up a creek since Juno (like all other free ISP software that I'm aware of) is Windows only.
</P>
<P>
So, once again I ask the question:
</P>
<P>
"Anyone know of any free LINUX-FRIENDLY ISP's in the continental USA?" A wide variety of access numbers would be ideal since I do travel with my Linux laptop but beggers can't be choosers, as they say. Thanks, all.

This would make a great article.  There are a fair handful of ppp-connection
apps like wvdial and kppp, but no clear documentation or wizard in the form
of "The windows user would do ... need to ask ISP 'blah blah blah' ... fill
them into &lt;whatever files or dialogs&gt;".  Most especially one that would have
the user able to successfully beat the "you're using linux?  we can't help
you then" gantlet at their ISP. (My advice for those: vote with your wallet.)
Probably the tech support of every major distro gets asked this sort of thing
a dozen or more times a day.

It appears that the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO hasn't been updated since early 1998.

Dear Sir,
</P>
<P>
I have Asus AGP TNT34000 display card with TV out/in support.
It works absolutely fine in Win9x.
It also works fine in X-windows.  But I am unable to get  TV-out support 
in Linux.
</P>
<P>
Finally I have change the display card to SiS 6326 (with has direct 
output feature to tv).
I am able to get the command line output to TV.  But when I try to run 
X-Windows,
I am  unable to see any thing.
There can be some errors in XF86Config file regarding PAL/NTSC 
resolution and frequency settings.
Can anyone point me to some web-sites (or documentations) for TV-out 
support or software.
</P>
<P>
Can you suggest some other cards, which can give tv-out support. I am 
using 21" Color AIWA TV.

I would like to see some articles on Tv-in/out(Video in/out) support.

Hi there.

<P>
I have set up a linux firewall, but one of the things I would like to do
with it (which I have so far been unable to accomplish) is access use port
forwarding to access a web server situated behind the firewall from a client
on the public internet.
</P>
<P>
I am using ipchains as my firewall mechanism, and have used redir and
ipmasqadm with no luck.
</P>
<P>
I am convinced that the problem lies somewhere in my ipchains scripting, but
I am not sure what to look for.  I have looked through various howto's and
webpages and am stuck.
</P>
<P>
What I was wondering is if you had a basic ipchains script that works in
conjunction with ipmasqadm to forward port 80 through to a web server behind
a firewall.
</P>
<P>
Any help that you can offer would be great!

<blockquote><EM><P>[ In this case there are almost too many HOWTOs ...

a useful "wizard" style tool for making sensible ipchains, or a similar one 
for the up-and-coming netfilters, reviewing it for us would make an excellent 
article.

<P>
One thing that is really great about Sun hardware is that you can get rid of
the monitor, mouse, and keyboard all together and do everything from install
the operating system to change EEPROM settings via a serial console.  While
Intel hardware was never designed this way, I cannot find much information
about setting up Linux on Intel to approximate this.  Is it possible to
install and boot Linux over a serial console?  Log-in in this way is easy,
but to be able to completely administer a system the install and boot
functions are critical, especially the Lilo prompt would be nice.

Hi,
</P>
<P>
I got stuck with 2 problems:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
1)  tried to dump  screen content using a cron job.  It basically is using
ImageMagick command import:
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P><code>
import -display 192.9.101.16:0 -window root fru.tif
</code></P>
<P>
However command fails (when run by crond, otherwise it runs from xterm just
fine) with following message:
</p>
<Pre>
Xlib: connection to "192.9.101.16:0.0" refused by server.
Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to server.
import: Unable to connect to X server (192.9.101.16:0).
</pre>
<p>
It should be noted that 192.9.101.16 is localhost.  It fails no matter if
I'm root or not.
What sort of authorization do I need to connect to XServer from cron?
</P>
<P>
2)My sendmail daemon takes ages to startup.  When I checked the log it says
few times:
May 29  08:52:03 piii sendmail [24126]: My unqualified host name (piii)
unknown; sleeping for retry.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that piii is the localhost defined in hosts file.
Furthermore when I tried to check the mail as a user it says it cannot find
the spool file.  I can create it manually but is it going to work? What sort
of configuration I need to do for sendmail when I need send and receive mail
only locally (mail exchange among local users only)?
</P>
<P>
Thanks in advance,
</P>

<P>
I can use the variable PLUSARG to base some procmail recipes.

So what's the question??? well it seems if I us and alieas set up
for me and the "+keyword" syntax that procmail doesn't pass the "+keyword" in
as the $1 parameter.  E.G. $1 is found when I use myid+keyword but not with
alieasId+keyword.

<P>
Hello Mr. Dennis!
</P>
<P>
I have had a problem writing a login script for compuserve in kppp dialer
</P>
<P>
The compuserve login procedure
requires that the port bits be set initially to 7 bit and later to 8 bit.
</P>
<P>
Also, it requires the setting of parity bit. 
</P>
<P>
The kppp dialer help section on login scripts indicates there is a MODE
command that make it possible
to set the port bits to 7 or 8 bits. But, the problem it is not in the
program in the section where you type in
the login script. They totally omitted this command. Also, how do you send
a ^M(I think this a control M)
in the kppp login script? Also, how do handle the parity bits? I am
connecting to compuserve but I am getting
an error message on the setting of the 8bits.
</P>
<P>
I AM ATTACHING TO THIS EMAIL THE COMPUSERVE LOGIN SCRIPT IS USE IN WINDOWS
98. THE FILE NAME IS CIS.TXT. THIS IS A TEXT FILE.
</P>
<P>
I did check with compuserve and 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Software and neither one could help
me. I am using Red Hat
6.2. I am using the kppp dialer that came with the Red Hat 6.2.
</P>
<P>
If you could help me with this, I would appreciate it very much. I look
forward to your comments in your Answerguy column.

Program) shell and connect to another device over layer 2 on a flat network.
I believe the syntax was:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
NCP&gt; connect via ewa-0 physical address 00-c0-75-00-21-00
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
ewa-0 being the nic of the localhost, and the final number being the
destination MAC address.  I could establish what was basically a telnet
session, but the device did not have to be configured with a correct IP
address for my subnet.  This is a much quicker way to configure a device
than hooking up a console to it.  When I was remote, I was able to telnet to
VMS (when I had a VMS box) and NCP to a device on that local net.
</P>
<P>
Is there any way to accomplish this same end in Linux?  I don't want my boss
tauting VMS over against Linux you know!
</P>
<P>
Thank you for your efforts.
</P>
<P>
Sincerely,
Scott A. King

Hi.
</P>
<P>
I've got an old Compaq Prosignia with onboard graphics "card".
The problem is that the parallel port is located at 0x3bc, irq 7.   For the
console monitor, I use an HP VGA mono monitor.  The problem with this is that
Linux decides that it's going to use ega rather than vga+. ega then tramples
over my parallel port resources so that I can't use it.
</P>
<P>
If I boot the box without a monitor, or with a colour SVGA monitor, vga+ is
then used, which uses different resources, hence allowing the parallel port
to work.
</P>
<P>
I've already tried to compile certain things in and out of the Kernel before
I realised that simply taking unplugging the monitor lead fixed it.
My question is: is there any way that I can either alter the resources (io
and IRQ) that the ega driver uses, or force it to use vga+ ?
The monitor I use for it is VGA anyway <TT>-</TT> and it's console only <TT>-</TT> not used for
X.
</P>
<P>
Thanks.
</P>

Hi,

I have a computer at home that has Linux (RH) 6.0 on it.. In my emacs I can set
the coding to Devnagri. But I wonder how can I get anything to type on the
screen. I am sure that I need to use a different inout system. But what?
Additionally, what do I have to do if I want to install support for more

</P>
<P>
Any pointer on this direction.

Hi Jim and Heather,
</P>
<P>
This ought to be an FAQ, or, at least, fodder for your Answer Guy
column:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
I've been trying to set up pop over ssh.  It isn't working.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
To test it, I've been trying to retrieve e-mail which steadily
accumulates on my new server, running qmail and it's pop daemon.  I've
also been trying to retrieve an e-mail sent to your
antares.starshine.org, since I have great confidence that your pop
server works.
</P>
<P>
I'm following the directions in the pop over ssh mini-HOWTO.  It still
doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
First, it isn't retrieving the mail.  Second, it asks me for the
passwords every time.  I thought the idea was to automate this so I
wouldn't have to type in the passwords every time.
</P>
<P>
At this point, I'm fairly dazed and confused.
</P>
<P>
I've run ssh-keygen on both machines and copied the keys back to the
authorized_keys file on my laptop to which I'm trying to retrieve  the
e-mail.  When I do ssh-agent getmail, it asks for the passphrase.
Okay, that much I expected.
</P>
<P>
Then, as I said above, it asks for the password for each server I'm
connecting to.  That would be fine, if it never asked again.  But,
five minutes later, it's forgotten the passwords and I have to type
them in again.  And so it goes, on and on.
</P>

Hello Jim, Heather and the new Answer Gang!
</P>
<P>
One of my clients has "seen the light" and is installing a rather
heavy-duty Linux box (PIII 600 Mhz, 256 Meg RAM, and five 9 Gig hard
drives configured as RAID 5) as their main server.  Two of their
requirements are secure ftp (I'm leaning towards sftp even if it is
commercial) and, this is the kicker, the ability to restart a failed
(unattended) ftp transfer.
</P>
<P>
After hitting Freshemat and Google/linux, I've found that the RFC for
ftp loosely defines a restart mechanism using a marker, but I've yet to
find an ftp client/server that actually implements it.  The FAQ for
ssh/sftp does not mention this capability.
</P>
<P>
Anyone in the Answer Gang have a brilliant answer/solution?

Hi Answerguy James T. Dennis,
</P>
<P>
I was pointed to your site through the linuxdoc site.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I cna be so bold as to ask a question.  I have <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> 2.1, and xdm
3.3.?.
</P>
<P>
I reinstalled fvwm95 the other night using dselect, and now xdm will not
launch any windows manager.  The xserver is up and running, I get the login
screen.  When I type my name and password, it tries to launch a windows
manager, and then, not being able to, reverts to the login screen again.
</P>
<P>
I am able to launch a windows environment by killing xdm under su, and then
as user, executing xinit, and launching fvwm95 through a bash shell from the
grey root screen.  This is a bit of a kludge, really.
</P>
<P>
I think that it has to do with file permissions, as fvwm works fine (apart
from the keyboard mappings).
</P>
<P>
There is no report of errors in .xsession-errors, or of problems in
<TT>/var/log/xdm.log</TT>, other than a report of me killing it.
</P>
<P>
I am sure the problem is very simple to you.
</P>
<P>
Regards,
<br>John Langley,

First of all, I am sorry if it shouldn't come to you like this. Could you
let me know who to send this email to, if there is a dedicated address?
</P>
<P>
Thanks.
</P>
<P>
I have two executable files that work when called manually. File2 is called
from within File1 so that when I run File1, File2 gets called as well.
</P>
<P>
When I set a CRONTAB job to run File1 (with the nested call to File2) ,
File1 runs, but File2 doesn't.
</P>
<P>
That's the simplified version.
</P>
<P>
The detailed version is that File1 dials out to an FTP server and downloads
File2 which is then supposed to run. I stress that when I manually run
File1, File2 is downloaded and runs correctly. When within a crontab job,
File1 runs, but doesn't appear to activate File2.
</P>
<P>
Is there something I am missing. My only thoughts lie in the fact that
perhaps I need to chmod the file in a different way, for it to be called
from within a crontab job successfully.
</P>
<P>
Any thoughts or Pointers?

Felt great. Went to create NewUser. Made big mistake. I created new Gnome
Icon in the panel. I don't want two. So I remove the panel. But, and I'm in
root of course, it removes the whole panel, not just the icon. I go to new
shell and type in shutdown commands. Re-login, but Gnome has lost it's
panel.
How do I get it back?

The company I'm working for is using Netware 4.1. And it is the company policy not to use IPX protocol. So, all Windows clients login into the server using IP protocol.
</P>
<P>
Is there any netware client for linux that uses IP to talk to the server? So far if I have not mistaken, all (ncpfs,nwclient and mars) uses IPX to talk to the server.
</P>
<P>
If there's no available software that I can use. Is there a work around it? Can I modify some settings on those client which makes them uses IP instead of IPX?
</P>
<P>
Is there anyway for me to make Linux login to NDS without sepcial clients?

Please tell me as soon as possible. I need the answer urgently. Thank you in advance.

Here is my question, I could not get a satisfactory answer from any of the

I want the user to be able to upload a file via the browser's file form

where it will be read into mySQL and then deleted from that directory.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, this cgi runs on Linux with <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> 1.3.9. I even downloaded the
latest, 1.3.12 and compiled it with mod_put.c into it. THe docs directory has
777 permissions temporarily. The script is written in Perl. After executing
the CGI script I have a 0K file created in the docs dir but the file is
empty.What is going on? How could I get this working?

For reference I include the code Perl here. THanks for the help.

<A HREF="../issue44/lg_bytes44.html">posting</A> of a requested comment I
sent a long time ago (August 1999). You could not imagine my heartfelt
glee (goosebumps) when I saw it (at the URL below).

<P> Thank you <STRONG>so</STRONG> much for putting that up, or even responding
to it.  Reactions to the Linux Bike Project have been extremely positive across
the board, and a few wonderful open-source community players have taken
interest in participating.  I am still brainstorming and drafting out ideas and
details for the epic bike ride, and would love to speak with you  if possible
(even just to say 'thank you' directly). 

<P> You can reach me at the following email address now:
<A HREF="mailto:karl@tux.org">karl@tux.org</A>

<P> THANK YOU again, and have a wonderful day!

<P>Yours sincerely,<BR>
Karl G. Pena

<BR>Subject: German <I>LG</I> translation needs web hosting

<P> Do you know a website hoster which is free and without advertisement?
We have a problem with the German translation of the Gazette in that we
don't have any space on a web server so we have to use free web space offers.
Do you know if one of your sponsors can offer us an account where we can 
upload up to 10 or later 20 MB?

<BR>Subject: translations of <EM>LG</EM>

<P> Hallo there,<BR>
LG#55, general Mail, translations of <EM>LG</EM>.<BR>
I think, it is a nonsense to translate English written computer texts: it is a
matter of general education to read English just as to be able to read and
write in your own language or to know some basic mathematics. Regards Werner
Gerstmann

<H4>The Editor wrote:</H4>

<P> While it may be true that university-educated people in a technical
field should be able to read computer articles in English, I don't think
that's a reasonable expectation for everybody in the world.  One of the
advantages of Linux over other OSes is that it's more international, so people
are on more of an equal footing than with some other OSes whose corporate
headquarters is in an English-speaking country.  Another advantage is that it's
accessible to people who can't afford to spend a month's salary on one copy of
Windows 2000.  These two facts alone mean Linux will be (and is being) used in
non-English speaking countries in ways that, um, No Other Operating System Has
Been Used Before...  &lt;Star Trek music in background&gt;  This means that
people in those countries will eventually contribute (and are contributing)
Linux software that wouldn't otherwise exist.

<P> Some of these contributions will be by people whose day job is not in
the computer industry.  Thus, they may have less of a reason to study
English.  Or, maybe they <EM>can</EM> read the English <EM>Gazette</EM> but
prefer not to.  Or maybe they're willing to read the English version, but would
also like to share the articles with family and friends who aren't
computer nerds and maybe don't speak English either.  What's wrong with that?
If it's making their use of Linux "just a little bit more fun", then <EM>Linux
Gazette</EM> is reaching its goal, no matter what language it's in.

<H4>Werner responded:</H4>

<P> Thank you for your mail on the translation issue, even though I wont change my opinion !

<P> What we need, or better, what I consider desirable, is a special online 
dictionary on certain new terms, not too simple, in English, of course, like
the Jargon File.

<P> Take e.g. the articles in the Linux Journal: what regards language, they 
are of very different level, beginning with What is Linux up to the sophi
sticated papers of Doc Searls and Stan Kelly-Bootle. Especially Mr. 
Kelly-Bootle seems to invent new word combinations and, of course, you have to
think about such compositions as beyond-the-soggy-pale or 
cosource-sweet-value-added, even if your mothers tongue is English, I suppose.
If I looked into my large Pons dictionary, I didnt find words like kludgy or
to shrink-wrap. These words I found in the excellent online dictionary of
Munich University at <A HREF="http://www.leo.org">www.leo.org</A>.

</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Hi Mike:

<P> Well, I have not counted all emails. But we have had many many emails with
congratulations about the site.  There are around 70 registered translators
and about 25 of those have actually done translations; the rest either are in
the process of translating something or said they will do so.

<P> With every new issue and announcement, traffic goes up very high and slowly
starts fading out during the course of the month, unless some new announcement
-kind of kick out everyone's curiosity- is made.

<P> <EM>La Gaceta de Linux</EM> is being linked from several linux related
sites (Spanish speaking most of them) and we are in a couple of search
engines now.

<P> In short, I guess that for two months online this is doing well.  What is
your opinion about it ?

<P> Actually a great effort from volunteers within the company has been put out
to build, install and manage the site.

<BR>Subject: Windows Partitions

<P>    I work at a TV station as System Administrator. This week a hard drive
failed in a computer, a very important computer. It controls 7 satellite
dishes, the azimuth and elevation can be adjusted from this machine. Also
the 7 receiver frequencies can be adjusted from this windows machine.
Without it we get no video feeds and have to order shows on tape, which
costs the station a great deal of money.

<P>   Now that I've given you the basics let me tell you how Linux saved the
day. When this hard drive failed windows could no longer determine what type
of partitions the drive had. I tried setting it up as a slave drive so I
could salvage our satellite software, windows couldn't see it so I booted
with Slackware rescue disks, ran fdisk and set the partitions to be Windows
FAT 16. Rebooted win98 in dos prompt mode and managed to copy ini files off
it.  With those ini files I was able to reconstruct another system. After
that I made several backups of the ini files. Linux gained a great deal of
respect within Tribune Broadcasting this week!!!

</P>

<P><STRONG>
Hi, I am looking for an open source job center management program.  Is the
one you use in your jobs section open source?  Can you recommend one?  We
are starting a small site in Phoenix and would like to integrate something
useful for careers.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks,
Steve Hasz
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm at work, you can reply to the above address or <A HREF="mailto:steve@hasz.com"

</STRONG></P>
<P>
The Career Center on the <EM>Linux Journal</EM> site is not open source at
present.  <EM>Linux Gazette's</EM> "Help Wanted" section is not about job 
offers, but about people seeking help with different aspects of
Linux.  Since you're seeking help about an aspect of Linux, we've put your 
letter here.  (Actually, in the "General Mail" section, but at least it's the
same page.

<P>
We build this page, as well as 2-Cent Tips and The Answer Gang, with the aid of
some hand-crafter Perl and Python scripts.  We sort the letters into standard
Unix mailboxes with particular filenames, and the scripts convert them to HTML.
However, we also post-process each column by hand to do things the scripts
can't.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A>.net is a canonical site for looking for open-source software;
the CPAN project (a perl script archive at 
<A HREF="http://cpan.org">cpan.org</A>) may also be useful.

<P> For examples of other functioning job centers--or to find a
developer to write one for you--see 
<A HREF="http://www.cosource.com">www.cosource.com</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.sourcexchange.com">www.sourcexchange.com</A> .  There are
also a few other companies offering a similar service.

<P> Perhaps you can adapt one of Linux's general "trouble ticket"-tracking
applications like <TT>gnats</TT> and <TT>jitterbug</TT> for your
purposes.

<P>-Heather and Mike

<H3>Steve wrote back:</H3>

<P> Thanks for your response!  We decided to just have one of our open source
developers write something, which turned out quite well.  We actually
created our entire site and run it using only modified open source.

<P>   could you please offer the all-in-one version of the Linux Gazette (HTML
as well as text) as a separate download? I don't understand why I have to
download these two files with every issue. Separating them from the standard
package would decrease it by ~ 1/3 of its size without any loss of
information.

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
[The all-in-one version requires some of the other files anyway (e.g.,
images, program listings, HTML files not part of the main article page).
The decision to not make separate packages for the all-in-one versions
was made by the former Editor (hi Margie!), because we already offer the
Gazette in a variety of formats and we can't customize it to everybody's
liking.

<P> We have a new Editor coming on board next month, Don Marti, so I'll leave
